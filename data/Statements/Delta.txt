In the last 90 days, we’ve experienced the best of humanity, with people coming together to care for one another and reigniting the meaning of community. Sadly, the tragedy in Minneapolis reminds us of the ugly reality that we are still experiencing humanity’s worst.

While thousands of our Delta Air Lines family members across Minneapolis – a city we consider our second home - and the world grieve, understanding our critical role as an ally is the first step.

Being a values-led brand means we not only raise our voices when something goes against our beliefs, we help amplify those who have been silenced. We often think we need all the answers, but it’s important to remember that we don’t need answers to know that racism, violence, bigotry and hatred have no seat at our table.

What happened in Minneapolis is not an outlier. Neither is what occurred in Georgia, New York and across the world where injustice lives in plain sight. While our words alone will not solve these crimes, thoughtful action combined with a focus on championing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace and within our personal lives will play a healing role to help us keep climbing. The Delta family will use whatever means we have to move the world toward a better, more just tomorrow. #UntilWeAllCare
