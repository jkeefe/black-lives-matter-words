Message from Jamie Dimon and Brian Lamb

This week’s terrible events in Minneapolis, together with too many others occurring around our country, are tragic and heartbreaking. Let us be clear — we are watching, listening and want every single one of you to know we are committed to fighting against racism and discrimination wherever and however it exists. 
This reality, coupled with the COVID crisis, highlights the inequities black and other diverse communities have and continue to face every day and it strengthens our resolve to do more as individuals, as a firm, and in our communities.
Now, more than ever, each of us must be inclusive in our work and in the neighborhoods where we operate. And above all else, we are here for all of you.
