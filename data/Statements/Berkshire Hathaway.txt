I wanted to say something earlier but was afraid it would come out wrong or that I wouldn't be able to find the words to express how I really feel.  However, I’ve realized that staying silent is far worse because, like you; I am outraged and heartbroken by the loss of life and the unequal treatment of the Black community.  The murders of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia are the most recent names added to a lengthy list of horrors faced by black people over the past several hundred years.  

During this troublesome time, even when most people are craving normalcy, we must not turn a blind eye to injustices and continue to stand on the sidelines.  Returning to the status quo will only perpetuate the damage being done.  Everyone must do more to support the Black community.

Taking the time to educate yourself and understand someone else’s perspective is one of the simplest, yet most powerful ways to show your support.  I'll admit until recently I didn't understand what the Black Lives Matter movement was actually about.  Why were the “All Lives Matter” social media posts looked at as racist?  

I had to be missing something. 

It was only after taking the time to read deeper on the subject that I finally understood why this is offensive and that the message of the Black Lives Matter movement is that black lives, because of racism, have never mattered as much as white lives, and until that changes, no lives should matter.  

Understanding is just the first step.  To make changes happen, action must follow. So as our agents return to the office over the coming weeks, I have asked that we share ideas with each other about ways we can show our support to the Black community both on macro and micro levels.  

As an office, we will work to:  
	•	Get more black people involved in the real estate industry  
	•	Offer internships or mentorships to black students here in Boston 
	•	Support black-owned businesses in and around Boston   
Agents have also made donations to organizations such as:
	•	Donate to Black Lives Matter
	•	Donate to the NAACP
	•	Donate to the ACLU
I am also covering the cost of NAR’s “At Home with Diversity” course for agents who want to participate and learn more - many agents have already signed up.

At Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Warren Residential, we stand with the Black community and are working to understand and make changes happen in the communities we serve. Each of us can make a difference through our actions, donations, and vote.
