Our belief is that progress happens when people feel secure, and we recognize that racism erodes that sense of security for the Black community. We continue to be reminded that painful bigotry and racial injustice exists in our society. Today and every day, we stand with the Black community â€“ our employees, families and friends, customers and philanthropic partners. We stand against hate-filled behavior and language, and remain dedicated to our global commitment to treat everyone with empathy, dignity and respect.
