The tragic death of Minneapolis resident George Floyd, and others like it in recent months, are traumatizing and unacceptably all too common. These tragedies have reaffirmed our commitment to live by our Sysco Values and cultivate a company culture that makes diversity, inclusiveness, equality and belonging top priorities.
We each have a role to play, and collectively, we must be able to talk about race, inequality and injustice. Together, we must stand up against racism and racial bias – they have no place at Sysco or in our communities. We all must be more inclusive in how we think and act, and truly understand what that means. Be respectful. Be sensitive to the views and experiences of others. Be kind. Be better.
My own first step was to sign the CEO Pledge, part of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an effort to rally the business community to advance Diversity & Inclusion within the workplace. We are also launching a new internal-focused “Real Talk” podcast and feature series, where we will invite diverse associates, allies, and leaders to have frank discussions about issues we face as a society and company, and in turn, what we can do collectively to work toward solutions.
@Sysco, we will not be silent about our fight against racism and discrimination. Our colleagues, customers and communities demand more from us. We simply must be better.
