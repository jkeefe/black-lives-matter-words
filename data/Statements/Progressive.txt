We stand in solidarity with our Black colleagues and all communities of color.
Diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to our core values and to an environment where all people can bring their authentic selves to work and feel safe, welcomed, valued and respected. We actively encourage employees to discuss critical issues such as racism through Employee Resource Groups and other forums, which you can learn more about on this site.
This June, we donated $1M through our foundation to the Equal Justice Initiative in support of the organization’s goals to end mass incarceration, excessive punishment and racial injustice. We know our words and actions aren’t enough to bring about broader change, so we are working to help enact change at a higher level through my involvement with the Business Roundtable and as a member of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion. We know that much work lies ahead in our communities. We must and will do more.
