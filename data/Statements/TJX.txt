For our country and the world, the tragic killing of George Floyd following so many others,
has brought to the forefront the significant racial injustice that still exists. While inclusion and
diversity have long been a priority at TJX, in these serious times, we recognize more than
ever that we need to continue working to do better. At TJX, we stand with Black Associates,
customers and communities and we stand against racial injustice.
Iâ€™d like to share with you how we, as a Company, are taking action. The TJX Foundation has
broadened its giving strategy to provide more direct support to Black communities. We are
increasing our global efforts by providing $10 million in grant funding over the next two years
to organizations that are actively working to combat racial injustice and systemic racism. The
funding will be divided among a number of organizations and, as this is a global issue, our
commitment will extend to support programs in Canada, Europe and Australia as well.
I believe that the diversity of our Associate base makes us a stronger Company and better
able to serve our broad base of customers around the world. We are initiating several
programs internally that will help us continue to grow a more inclusive and diverse
organization at all levels. Action is necessary to make a difference and as an organization,
we know we can do more, and you have our commitment that we will.
