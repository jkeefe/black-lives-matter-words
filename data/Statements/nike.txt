Today NIKE, Inc. is announcing a $40 million commitment over the next four years to support the Black community in the U.S. on behalf of the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands collectively. This commitment will be focused on investing in and supporting organizations that put social justice, education and addressing racial inequality in America at the center of their work. 
“Systemic racism and the events that have unfolded across America over the past few weeks serve as an urgent reminder of the continued change needed in our society. We know Black Lives Matter. We must educate ourselves more deeply on the issues faced by Black communities and understand the enormous suffering and senseless tragedy racial bigotry creates,” said John Donahoe, President and CEO of NIKE, Inc. “The NIKE, Inc. family can always do more but will never stop striving to role model how a diverse company acts. We will continue our focus on being more representative of our consumers while doing our part in the communities we serve.”
We believe in a level playing field for all and leveraging the power of sport and our brands to move the world forward. This additional $40 million builds upon the NIKE, Inc. family’s long history of providing support to the communities in which they operate in. We are deeply committed to driving focus and impact through our teams, brands and community partners. 
During this past year, we’ve stepped up our own efforts and measures of accountability in the areas of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging to foster an inclusive environment and attract a more diverse workforce. We are driven by a commitment to transparency, accountability and impact and share our progress in these areas annually through the Nike Impact Report.
