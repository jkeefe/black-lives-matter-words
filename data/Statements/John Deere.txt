Hatred and discrimination have no place in our society. At John Deere, our actions speak for us. We act for one another, our customers, our dealers, our communities, and the world around us. Today, we’re pledging $1M to the NAACP Empowerment Programs to fight against racial inequality. We’re also providing a 2:1 match on U.S. employee donations to several social justice organizations. And we stand ready to strengthen our longstanding work with organizations like the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, Executive Leadership Council, National Society of Black Engineers, National Black Growers Council, and MANRRS. Together we will create lasting change.
