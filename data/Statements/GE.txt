Colleagues,
Since my initial note to you last month following the murder of George Floyd, the topic of GE’s own practices and actions on inclusion and diversity has been on my mind constantly. I’ve spoken to many Black leaders inside and outside of GE during this time. A week ago, I joined our African American Forum (AAF) town hall with nearly 1,800 GE employees for a spirited hour of conversation. The questions raised by our colleagues were tough and fair, and the personal stories were deeply impactful. I am listening and continue to develop insight into how we as GE can rise to the challenge to build a world that works…for everyone. That job begins with me and my leadership team. But, ultimately, we all have a role. 
Today, I am sharing actions GE is taking on what will be a long and much-needed journey toward sustainable change with real impact. You have gotten to know me in these last 20 months, and I hope you have learned that I favor action over words, and I don’t sign up for commitments we can’t fulfill. With that in mind, there are important steps we will take to move us forward. Let us recognize that there is no quick fix. We have work to do, but it’s work we can do, and I am deeply committed to seeing it through.
With all of this in mind, here are our first actions:
Accountability
To drive progress, we will harness the power of corporate, our businesses and the HR function. And in concert with our overall efforts to shift GE’s focus and resources to the business units, that is where much of the important work will take place. I am heartened by the commitment from all our business CEOs to take this on and drive accountability. 
	•	At the Corporate level, I will name a Chief Diversity Officer to join my senior team, selected from among our senior leaders known for accountability and driving business results.
	•	Each GE business also will name a Chief Diversity Officer on their leadership team, mirroring the concept I described above.
	•	We will reinstate our CEO Diversity Council, a roundtable of all our business Chief Diversity Officers and GE-wide Affinity Network leaders, to meet with my senior team, our business CEOs and me on a quarterly basis. You can expect these meetings to have the same rigor as our operating reviews where we get to root cause on problems and embrace the “red” in order to improve. 
	•	Business CEOs will assume active sponsorship for each of our Affinity Groups. Having business champions drives a new level of accountability as well as additional inclusivity as our CEOs gain invaluable perspectives. And while today’s actions respond to recent events and discussions with our Black colleagues and their allies in the GE community, we are committed to ensuring our efforts are also inclusive of all our under-represented groups.
	•	During our Monthly Op Reviews, each business CEO and their Senior HR Managers will now report on their Inclusion and Diversity KPIs so we have regular visibility and accountability as we do with all critical business metrics.
 Transparency
	•	Many of you have asked about our diversity data. With transparency as one of our core Leadership behaviors, I’ve asked Kevin Cox to explore and come back to me with a recommendation as to how we can responsibly and transparently share our diversity data. Other companies are taking this step, and I view it as important for GE. I don’t think our metrics will surprise – or satisfy – anyone, but they will indicate the progress we have yet to make.
Talent Development
	•	We will direct and empower the business HR heads to create a strong and effective mentoring, development and sponsorship program for rising diverse talent. I have found mentorship to be invaluable and want to consider how we do this in a thoughtful and sustainable way. I also plan to invest more of my own time in mentoring our next generation of leaders. I love to teach and share my experiences and doing this with a diverse set of leaders is a priority.
 Community
	•	As I’ve written before, my wife and I are strong believers in education. It’s an important family value of ours, and we believe the single most important driver of economic inclusion. Creating educational opportunity is a focal point for much of our personal philanthropy, including the funding of the GE Chairman scholarships.
 With this in mind, I’ve asked the GE Foundation to explore ways we can build on this, starting with an initial $1MM contribution to fund economic inclusion with a primary focus on education and retraining. This action is consistent with the GE Foundation’s long history of supporting education and workforce diversity programs. I’ve asked Russell Stokes to work with Linda Boff and the Foundation to crystallize where this future investment will have the greatest impact.
I believe that the issues we are facing must be addressed at their root cause to ensure we create sustainable change that brings equity and justice to not only our Black communities but all other diverse communities.
Our Values
At GE, we believe in the value of your unique identity, background, and experiences. We know that by embracing diverse teams and perspectives we are better equipped to innovate, to solve big problems, and to deliver for our customers.
We are committed to fostering a culture of respect. And that means we hold our employees and our leaders to the highest standards. Each of us is an ambassador for GE, and how we conduct ourselves both at and outside of work should be done respectfully. GE has no tolerance for racist words, actions or attitudes.
In closing, I want to thank the many employees who have shared their personal stories and experiences with me. I have been deeply touched. I hold these close and they underscore that we have a great deal of work to do as a company and as a country. And as I said during the AAF town hall last week, Black lives matter…absolutely. 
These are the actions we are announcing today and upon which we will build and grow. As I said when I wrote to you about these issues last month, our first Leadership behavior is “Act with Humility.” Humility begins by admitting none of us have all the answers. I encourage us all to listen intently to the needs and perspectives of others and work together to make meaningful progress.
I invite your thoughts and deeply appreciate your support.
