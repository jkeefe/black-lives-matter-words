For all of us who care deeply about diversity, equality and fairness, itâ€™s been painful and heartbreaking to watch the tragic events of this past week in Minneapolis and in several other parts of America. These events are emblematic of the inequities that black and other diverse communities face on a daily basis. The need for change is evident and we know that more work needs to be done to ensure that all people in all communities feel included, equal and safe. As a company that is deeply committed to diversity, inclusion and human rights, we will strengthen our resolve in advocating for change and in doing our part so that we build a society that protects all people and values all voices.
