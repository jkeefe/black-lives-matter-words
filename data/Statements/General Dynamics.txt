GDIT stands firmly behind the ideals of equality, liberty and justice. We strive to make GDIT a place where every employee feels valued and respected; one where employees see themselves and feel heard. Weâ€™re working with our Black Employee Network to listen, learn and continue to evolve our strategy around diversity and inclusivity.
