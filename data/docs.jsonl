{"_source": {"content": "A Statement From Our Chairman And CEO On Our Opposition To Racism And Our Promotion Of Equality And Opportunity\nDARIUS ADAMCZYK | CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n\nJune 17, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike you, I have been personally outraged by the terrible killings of George Floyd and many other Black people within our U.S. communities. It is upsetting to think that racism continues to persist in our society, denying individuals the basic principles of equality and opportunity because of the color of their skin or their racial or ethnic origin.\nLet me state up-front and very clearly that we will never tolerate racism at Honeywell. Fully embracing the principles of Inclusion and Diversity and treating all employees with the utmost respect every day are requirements for working here. If you can\u2019t do this, you don\u2019t belong at Honeywell. I must also emphasize that along with Black employees, we are committed to supporting the inclusion of all diverse groups across our global workforce.\nDuring the past couple of weeks, my leadership team and I have talked with Black employees from a cross-section of our company to better understand their perspectives. We have learned much from them, including the fact that we as leaders don\u2019t have all the answers \u2013 but there is much that we can do to make progress at Honeywell. We are committed to listening more and acting more as we move forward.\nWhat We Are Already Doing\nWe also heard consistently that employees don\u2019t know a lot about what we are already doing to promote diversity and specifically to support Black- and minority-oriented institutions. While we have much to do, we also have to do a better job of communicating our current initiatives and programs and the future activities we will pursue.\nFor starters, we have a Board of Directors that is widely recognized for its diversity, with 2 African Americans, 4 women, 2 Hispanics, and 1 non-U.S. citizen representing a wide range of professional experiences and perspectives. This independent Board sets the tone for all of Honeywell and takes an active interest in ensuring we have a truly diverse workforce that represents all races, religions, geographies, and perspectives. They share my view that our diversity makes us stronger, and they challenge us to push ourselves in this area.\nPrior to the tragic death of George Floyd, Honeywell committed to a five-year corporate sponsorship of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. As part of the Smithsonian, this museum hosts millions of visitors a year and focuses on the richness, diversity, and resiliency of the African American experience. It may be a relatively new museum, but it is already an American icon.\nWe also committed to a two-year partnership this spring with the Carolina Youth Coalition (CYC), which provides opportunity to high-achieving, under-resourced minority students \u2013 the vast majority who are Black \u2013 by helping them enter, excel in, and graduate from college. We will support CYC not only with funding but also with the time and attention of our leadership volunteers.\nDuring the past school year, we supported Druid Hills Academy, a Title 1 school in North Charlotte that serves an underprivileged area. We did a clean-up day on the campus with 80 volunteers and sponsored a 20-week coding program aimed at elementary and middle school students.\nHoneywell Connected Enterprise (HCE) partnered with Black Girls Code in Atlanta to host girls of ages 7-17 from underrepresented communities to introduce them to technology and computer science. HCE also hosted more than 100 Posse Foundation scholarship recipients to help them build interviewing and job application skills.\nWe have sponsored learning programs for Jobs for America\u2019s Graduates chapters in Arizona, North Carolina, and South Carolina for at-risk high school youth. Last year, JAG recognized Honeywell with its Highly Engaged Employer Partner Award.\nIn 2019, we entered into a three-year Integrated Pipeline Program with the National Society of Black Engineers to strengthen our recruitment of new employees as well as professional development opportunities focused on retaining mid-career professionals. To date, we\u2019ve sponsored 36 scholarships through NSBE and are working to support summer camps and high school NSBE programs in 2020 and 2021. The camps promote science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and will be held in Charlotte, Chicago, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C. We have also expanded our partnership with several Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, we improved hiring of Black students from campuses by 54% and improved our overall hiring rate of Black employees by 36% during the same period. As of May, 7 of 10 roles posted across Honeywell had diverse slates \u2013 a nearly double-digit increase from the previous year. It\u2019s good progress, but we have a long way to go.\u00a0\nWhat We Are Committed to Doing\nWhen the killing of George Floyd led to street protests throughout the U.S., we immediately initiated a series of listening sessions so our leaders could hear directly from Black employees in different roles and at different levels of the company. We have found these sessions to be valuable and will extend them to other groups.\nIn addition to continuing leadership listening sessions, we are committing today to the following actions:\u00a0\n\t\u2022\tWe will continue to evolve our community relations programs and partnerships with key external organizations to emphasize diversity and opportunity across a broad range of society.\u00a0A good example of this is\u00a0our announcement today\u00a0that we are Founding Sponsor of the Charlotte Center City Small Business Innovation Fund. We have committed $2 million this year to provide grants of up to $40,000 to small businesses with 50 or fewer employees. The grants will help these small enterprises survive the changing environment brought on by COVID through investments in technologies or upgraded marketing or business practices. When selecting grant recipients, we will prioritize minority-, women- and veteran-owned businesses. We have great partners on board to help us get moving quickly, and we are excited about what this program can do to help small business owners.\u2028\u2028\n\t\u2022\tWe will intensify our focus on the recruiting, retention, and development of Black employees along with women and other minority groups.\u00a0Two years ago, we introduced the Women\u2019s Advancement Program to pair rising female executives with career champions while providing them access to career development and networking opportunities. Thanks to the success of this program, we are now planning to extend it to Black employees and other minority groups. In addition, we will deploy training for all employees in areas such as unconscious bias, with input from our employees on the content, and we will expand and strengthen Honeywell Black Employees Network chapters.\u2028\u2028\n\t\u2022\tWe will enforce a revised zero tolerance policy\u00a0under our Code of Business Conduct, which makes it explicit that there is zero tolerance specifically for racial discrimination. Zero tolerance means that anyone who engages in harassing or discriminatory behavior is subject to appropriate disciplinary measures, up to and including termination of employment. If anyone experiences, or witnesses, any behavior that is not in line with our racial discrimination policy, it is our expectation and requirement that you report it immediately to your supervisor, Human Resources, Legal, or the Access Helpline. Remember, we will never tolerate retaliation against those who step forward in good faith to report problems or concerns related to our Harassment Policy or Code of Business Conduct.\nThese steps are a starting point, not an end \u2013 and I\u2019m counting on all of you to be the champions we need to ensure that racially discriminatory practices WILL NOT reside at Honeywell. Our leaders will be held especially accountable for fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace in which employees of all races feel valued, respected, and accepted.\nAs we approach this Friday\u2019s 155th anniversary of Juneteenth, the oldest national celebration of the ending of slavery in the U.S., we can take pride in all that we do to foster diversity. At the same time, we are humbled by what remains to be done and committed to continuing to make progress.\nThank you in advance for your support.\n"}, "_id": "Honeywell.txt"}

{"_source": {"content": "Standing strong together \nThis has been an incredibly difficult time in America\u2014troubling and sad. The murder of George Floyd is an atrocity. We all stand in horror, grieving as a nation alongside his family and his community. To see a man killed, a life ended cruelly and senselessly is something that will haunt me forever. But for people of color in communities all over this country and around the world\u2014that footage is not a surprise, it is all too familiar. The fault lines of our society are laid bare. From the devastating and disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 to the devastating impacts of police brutality, the long-standing racial injustice in America that began 400 years ago is impossible to ignore. And the people who have been ignored are now demanding to be heard. We are listening. \n\nI recently spent some time with a group of black team members\u2014mostly listening. How are we doing? Have we succeeded in creating a company where all our team members feel safe and valued? How can we do more? How can we do better? What was supposed to be a one-hour meeting lasted much longer. I\u2019ve been thinking about the conversation a lot, about our team members, our friends and families. The main thing I heard was we need to create space for tough conversations, have greater leadership accountability and take actions that drive positive socio-economic change for communities of color. I am optimist about what we\u2019ve built at Dell, of our culture that\u2019s designed to support every team member in reaching their full potential, and of our vision for where we\u2019re going. I\u2019ve always believed diversity is power. It\u2019s how we win and win the right way. We can lead by example and lean into our inclusive culture. We can lead by example and surround each other in love and support when we need it most. \n\nLater this week, our Black Networking Alliance ERG will hold a moment of reflection to recognize and hear from those who are most affected by recent acts of violence. I\u2019d ask that everyone please join with us in this moment. Additionally, our Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, Brian Reaves, is talking internally and with our partners to see where additional investment is needed. We need to do things differently now so that we can lead measurable change and truly be an employer of choice for all. I encourage you to get involved. Because for all the word we do within our own company, there will never be true justice or equality until we root out the rotten underbelly of racism that is eating away at the most cherished values we hold dear. Real change requires us all to actively participate in the hard work that lies ahead\u2026the hard work that has to be done for our nation and our world to hear, grow strong, and for us to move forward as one people with a shared voice. \n\nI am thinking about my role. I hope you are thinking about yours. This is a time to stand strong together. Let\u2019s be kind. Let\u2019s be loving. Let\u2019s stand up for each other and be the change. "}, "_id": "Dell.txt"}
{"_source": {"content": "Colleagues,\nSince my initial note to you last month following the murder of George Floyd, the topic of GE\u2019s own practices and actions on inclusion and diversity has been on my mind constantly. I\u2019ve spoken to many Black leaders inside and outside of GE during this time. A week ago, I joined our African American Forum (AAF) town hall with nearly 1,800 GE employees for a spirited hour of conversation. The questions raised by our colleagues were tough and fair, and the personal stories were deeply impactful.\u00a0I am listening and continue to develop insight into how we as GE can rise to the challenge to build a world that works\u2026for everyone.\u00a0That job begins with me and my leadership team. But, ultimately, we all have a role.\u00a0\nToday, I am sharing actions GE is taking on what will be a long and much-needed journey toward sustainable change with real impact.\u00a0You have gotten to know me in these last 20 months, and I hope you have learned that I favor action over words, and I don\u2019t sign up for commitments we can\u2019t fulfill. With that in mind, there are important steps we will take to move us forward.\u00a0Let us recognize that there is no quick fix. We have work to do, but it\u2019s work we can do, and I am deeply committed to seeing it through.\nWith all of this in mind, here are our first actions:\nAccountability\nTo drive progress, we will harness the power of corporate, our businesses and the HR function. And in concert with our overall efforts to shift GE\u2019s focus and resources to the business units, that is where much of the important work will take place. I am heartened by the commitment from all our business CEOs to take this on and drive accountability.\u00a0\n\t\u2022\tAt the Corporate level, I will name a\u00a0Chief Diversity Officer\u00a0to join my senior team, selected from among our senior leaders known for accountability and driving business results.\n\t\u2022\tEach GE business also will name a Chief Diversity Officer\u00a0on their leadership team, mirroring the concept I described above.\n\t\u2022\tWe will reinstate our\u00a0CEO Diversity Council,\u00a0a roundtable of all our business Chief Diversity Officers and GE-wide Affinity Network leaders, to meet with my senior team, our business CEOs and me on a quarterly basis. You can expect these meetings to have the same rigor as our operating reviews where we get to root cause on problems and embrace the \u201cred\u201d in order to improve.\u00a0\n\t\u2022\tBusiness CEOs will assume\u00a0active sponsorship for each of our Affinity Groups.\u00a0Having business champions drives a new level of accountability as well as additional inclusivity as our CEOs gain invaluable perspectives. And while today\u2019s actions respond to recent events and discussions with our Black colleagues and their allies in the GE community, we are committed to ensuring our efforts are also inclusive of all our under-represented groups.\n\t\u2022\tDuring our Monthly Op Reviews, each business CEO and their Senior HR Managers will now report on their\u00a0Inclusion and Diversity KPIs\u00a0so we have regular visibility and accountability as we do with all critical business metrics.\n\u00a0Transparency\n\t\u2022\tMany of you have asked about our diversity\u00a0data.\u00a0With transparency as one of our core Leadership behaviors, I\u2019ve asked\u00a0Kevin Cox\u00a0to explore and come back to me with a recommendation as to how we can responsibly and transparently share our diversity data. Other companies are taking this step, and I view it as important for GE. I don\u2019t think our metrics will surprise \u2013 or satisfy \u2013 anyone, but they will indicate the progress we have yet to make.\nTalent Development\n\t\u2022\tWe will direct and empower the business HR heads to create a\u00a0strong and effective mentoring, development and sponsorship program\u00a0for rising diverse talent. I have found mentorship to be invaluable and want to consider how we do this in a thoughtful and sustainable way. I also plan to invest more of my own time in\u00a0mentoring our next generation of leaders. I love to teach and share my experiences and doing this with a diverse set of leaders is a priority.\n\u00a0Community\n\t\u2022\tAs I\u2019ve written before, my wife and I are strong believers in education. It\u2019s an important family value of ours, and we believe the single most important driver of economic inclusion. Creating educational opportunity is a focal point for much of our personal philanthropy, including the funding of the GE Chairman scholarships.\n\u00a0With this in mind, I\u2019ve asked the\u00a0GE Foundation\u00a0to explore ways we can build on this, starting with an initial\u00a0$1MM contribution to fund economic inclusion\u00a0with a primary focus on education and retraining. This action is consistent with the GE Foundation\u2019s long history of supporting education and workforce diversity programs. I\u2019ve asked\u00a0Russell Stokes\u00a0to work with\u00a0Linda Boff\u00a0and the Foundation to crystallize where this future investment will have the greatest impact.\nI believe that the issues we are facing must be addressed at their root cause to ensure we create sustainable change that brings equity and justice to not only our Black communities but all other diverse communities.\nOur Values\nAt GE, we believe in the value of your unique identity, background, and experiences. We know that by embracing diverse teams and perspectives we are better equipped to innovate, to solve big problems, and to deliver for our customers.\nWe are committed to fostering a culture of respect. And that means we hold our employees and our leaders to the highest standards. Each of us is an ambassador for GE, and how we conduct ourselves both at and outside of work should be done respectfully. GE has no tolerance for racist words, actions or attitudes.\nIn closing, I want to thank the many employees who have shared their personal stories and experiences with me. I have been deeply touched. I hold these close and they underscore that we have a great deal of work to do as a company and as a country. And as I said during the AAF town hall last week, Black lives matter\u2026absolutely.\u00a0\nThese are the actions we are announcing today and upon which we will build and grow. As I said when I wrote to you about these issues last month, our first Leadership behavior is \u201cAct with Humility.\u201d Humility begins by admitting none of us have all the answers. I encourage us all to listen intently to the needs and perspectives of others and work together to make meaningful progress.\nI invite your thoughts and deeply appreciate your support.\u00a0\n"}, "_id": "GE.txt"}

As the employers of more than 15 million individuals of all backgrounds, whose diversity strengthens our institutions, Business Roundtable CEOs are deeply concerned about the racial bias that continues to plague our society. At a time of great uncertainty, when communities of color are facing deep inequities, now is a time for unity and justice. We call on national, local and civic leaders to take urgent, thoughtful action to prevent future tragedies and to help our communities heal.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nI support this statement by the Business Roundtable and believe it also reflects our position at ConocoPhillips. We still have a way to go on our D&I journey, but we have an opportunity to learn from this moment and make our \u201cWho We Are\u201d culture even stronger. Thank you for your commitment to eliminate bias and injustice in all its forms. \u00a0\nStay safe, \u00a0\u2028Ryan\n"}, "_id": "ConocoPhillips.txt"}

And how these issues can linger, simmer, and boil over\u2014into our hearts and onto our streets. The images and stories that fill our phones and TV screens are heartbreaking, leaving us sad, frustrated, or angry. We know that many in our community, including many of our Black associates, are hurting deeply.\u00a0\nIt is often easier and more convenient to avoid uncomfortable conversations on race, justice, and equality. Thank you to those who have shared with me personally your emotions and your struggles over the past few days. And I am grateful to all of you who have stepped up to have difficult conversations or share your feelings with each other. We must seek to walk in the shoes of others. Acknowledging the pain being felt today by our colleagues and fellow citizens is vital. And creating the space and grace to listen, and to live our values actively and without judgment, is more important now than ever.\nAt Capital One, we reject racism in all its forms. From our founding days, we have been committed to the dignity, respect, and inclusion of every associate. And to unleashing every person\u2019s talents and potential\u2014no matter their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual identity, age, disability, or background. We have built a company that endeavors to be a welcoming and inspiring place for all. We seek and embrace diversity. We are committed to having a workforce that is representative of America. And I am hopeful that together we can harness the sadness, anger, and energy of these difficult times to elevate the discussion, drive positive change, and create a greater sense of shared purpose and understanding.\nI wish you and your loved ones health and strength in these challenging times. And thank you for making Capital One a special place for each of us to work, to be ourselves, and to succeed.\nRich\n"}, "_id": "Capital One.txt"}

{"_source": {"content": "Dear Senators Booker and Harris, and Representatives Bass, Jeffries, and Nadler:\nIn September 1953, more than a decade before the passage Of the Civil Rights Act, IBM took a bold stand in favor of equal opportunity. Thomas J. Watson, Jr., then president of IBM, wrote to all employees:\n\u201d . . .Each Of the citizens of this country has an equal right to live and work in America. It is the policy of this organization to hire people who have the personality, talent and background necessary to fill a given job, regardless of race, color or creed.\u201d\nWatson backed up this statement with action, refusing to enforce Jim Crow laws at IBM facilities. Yet nearly seven decades later, the horrible and tragic deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and too many others remind us that the fight against racism is as urgent as ever.\nTo that end, IBM would like to work with Congress in pursuit of justice and racial equity, focused initially in three key policy areas: police reform, responsible use of technology, and broadening skills and educational opportunities. Our suggestions include:\nPolice reform \u2013 new federal rules should hold police more accountable for misconduct.\nCongress should bring more police misconduct cases under federal court purview and should make modifications to the qualified immunity doctrine that prevents individuals from seeking damages when police violate their constitutional rights. Congress should also establish a federal registry of police misconduct and adopt measures to encourage or compel states and localities to review and update use-of-force policies. We also urge Congress to consider legislation such as the Walter Scott Notification Act, sponsored by Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, which would require that states receiving federal funding report more details on the use of deadly force by law enforcement officers to the Department of Justice so that an accurate picture of such incidents is available for public scrutiny and analysis.\nSeveral of these suggestions are included in the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 that you recently introduced. IBM welcomes your early leadership in announcing these proposals and stands ready to work with you and other Members of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, toward broad bipartisan legislation that can be enacted into law.\nResponsible technology policies \u2013 technology can increase transparency and help police protect communities but must not promote discrimination or racial injustice.\nIBM no longer offers general purpose IBM facial recognition or analysis software. IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and\u00a0Principles of Trust and Transparency. We believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.\nArtificial Intelligence is a powerful tool that can help law enforcement keep citizens safe. But vendors and users of Al systems have a shared responsibility to ensure that Al is tested for bias, particularity when used in law enforcement, and that such bias testing is audited and reported.\nFinally, national policy also should encourage and advance uses of technology that bring greater transparency and accountability to policing, such as body cameras and modern data analytics techniques.\nExpanding opportunity \u2013 training and education for in-demand skills is key to expanding economic opportunity for communities of color.\nWe need to create more open and equitable pathways for all Americans to acquire marketable skills and training, and the need is particularly acute in communities of color. At IBM, we see an urgent demand for what we call \u201cnew collar\u201d jobs, which require specialized skills but not necessarily a traditional 4-year college degree. Such jobs can still be found today in fast-growing fields from cybersecurity to cloud computing. We urge Congress to consider national policies to expand the number and reach of programs such as:\nP-TECH\u00a0\u2013 Developed by IBM earlier this decade, P-TECH is a grade 9-14 school model where students earn both their high school diploma and a no-cost associates degree in a STEM field without incurring student debt. Today, 220 P- TECH schools are serving 150,000 students worldwide, with a heavy focus on students of color in educationally underserved areas in the United States. From Brooklyn to Chicago, from Dallas to Baltimore, these schools are creating real opportunities and real jobs for young people today. We should scale them nationally.\nPell Grants\u00a0\u2013 Today Pell Grants are an important pathway for students of color\u2028to go to college. But there are virtually no Federal funds available for non-college skills training or job certification programs for in-demand New Collar jobs. Eligibility for Pell Grants should be expanded \u2013 including for incarcerated persons \u2013 beyond traditional four-year degree programs so that students with real economic need can build relevant skills through other education and training pathways that fit their life circumstances.\nWe offer these suggestions in the constructive spirit of problem-solving that has always defined our company and its people. We realize these measures are only a beginning, but IBM wants to help advance this nation\u2019s pursuit of equity and justice and we stand ready to work with you to advance policies that will help unify our country and advance our national purpose.\nSincerely,\u2028Arvind Krishna\n"}, "_id": "IBM.txt"}
{"_source": {"content": "[Note: These are remarks James Quincey prepared and first shared with Coca-Cola employees during a virtual town hall on June 3.]\n\nGeorge Floyd. Killed. A senseless tragedy for him and his family. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. Philando Castile. Sandra Bland. Freddie Gray. Michael Brown. Eric Garner. Tamir Rice. Trayvon Martin. All killed. All Black Americans, predominantly male Black Americans. All of whom should be alive today.\u2028\n\nI, like you, am outraged, sad, frustrated, angry. Companies like ours must speak up as allies to the Black Lives Matter movement. We stand with those seeking justice and equality.\n\nReality is that there is still a wound in the fabric of America that is not just not healed \u2013 but is being reopened. Racism. It begets violence, it begets death.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly 30 years since the video of Rodney King being beaten by police officers shocked the world. At the time, we spoke out. Roberto Goizueta, then-Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, said at an event, \u201cDefending justice, creating economic opportunity and ensuring quality education is more than a noble cause. It is our duty. Nothing we value\u2026 our families, homes and businesses\u2026are safe in the face of oppression, poverty and ignorance.\u201d\n\nIt is our duty.\n\nNow, with George Floyd\u2019s death, I\u2019ve been reflecting on our duty to Black people in America. Simply put, America hasn\u2019t made enough progress, corporate America hasn\u2019t made enough progress and nor has The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nAs a nation and as individuals, we must do better. Businesses like ours can play an important role. As a company that believes diversity and inclusion are among our greatest strengths, we must put our resources and energy toward helping end the cycle of systemic racism.\n\nThe company is not perfect. It\u2019s done great things, things to be proud of. From the emblematic to the sustained. From celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., through being the first to have African-Americans in advertising, to providing leaders to work on desegregation, to education, to South Africa, to refranchising to two new African-American entrepreneur-owned U.S. bottlers. One of whom, Troy Taylor, is with us today [as a speaker in the company\u2019s town hall].\n\nAnd it\u2019s made mistakes, including the grave one with the largest discrimination lawsuit in U.S. history in 1999/2000. As the judge said, our biggest issue was not that we made mistakes and that there were individual cases, but that when we knew, we didn\u2019t act to remedy and improve.\n\nWe don\u2019t have all the answers. But I believe that we, together with civic and community advocates, government officials, fellow business leaders, our partners \u2013 and with the views and voices of those who challenge injustice \u2013 we can find solutions.\n\n\n\nOur efforts will focus on four main areas \u2013 listening, leading, investing, advocating.\n\nLISTENING: We believe our company and our brands have the power to drive change. And we want to get this right. In order to make progress for those who have been hurt by systemic racism, we need first to listen. We have ideas; we received ideas from employees, and we know that this is the beginning. That\u2019s why we\u2019re spending time listening to employees and seeking their input on meaningful actions we can take, both internal and external. We will seek out the voices and expertise of community leaders and social justice advocates to inform our actions. And we will continue to use multiple forms to continue to listen, to further the actions that we will take to lead, invest and advocate.\n\nLEADING: As a company, we need internally to be an example for corporate America and society overall, otherwise what platform do we have to lead from? We need to take multiple actions. We will renew the mandatory diversity and inclusion training. Also, the company donated the land and helped set up the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, here in Atlanta right next to the World of Coke, but how many of us have visited it? We all need to go and spend time there. It\u2019s four years since we had the first [internal company] Stand As One conversation following a similar death. Taking one measure \u2013 representation of African-Americans as a percentage of our U.S. employees \u2013 we\u2019ve made mixed progress. In the total numbers, we\u2019re up 3 points to 19%, ahead of overall country [population]. But in leadership positions, grade 14-plus, we are flat, at a poor 7%. We need to be more effective in making progress. So we\u2019re appointing leaders in our business to drive the development and implementation of additional business actions.\n\nINVESTING: We will invest our resources to advance social justice causes. We will use the voices of our brands to weigh in on important social conversations. For example, today we are announcing $2.5 million in grants from The Coca-Cola Foundation for the\u00a0Equal Justice Initiative\u00a0to assist advocates and policymakers in the critically important work of criminal justice reform; the\u00a0NAACP Legal Defense Fund\u00a0in support of the \u201cPolicing Reform Campaign;\u201d and the\u00a0National Center for Civil and Human Rights\u00a0to deliver a platform to bring people together for powerful conversations that matter and inspire social change and their current \u201cCampaign for Equal Dignity.\u201d In addition, we will match employee donations to these initiatives, as well as contributions to the\u00a0100 Black Men of America\u00a0and the\u00a0National CARES Mentoring Movement. Starting with me.\n\nADVOCATING: Together with our bottling system, we will work through our business network to support change and embrace policies that matter, starting with publicly supporting legislation to advance a hate-crimes law in Georgia. We also will continue to support collective actions and pledges across the business community, such as the Business Roundtable, the Atlanta Committee for Progress and CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion. And more will need to be done.\n\nAt times, this will be challenging and uncomfortable, and it will require courage, humility, dedication and reflection.\n\nOur pledge as a company is that we will do our part to listen, learn and act. Coca-Cola is committed to making a difference in our communities and within our company by mobilizing our history of advancing civil rights and by rallying the strength of our employees, families and friends. Our company must play a visible and proactive role in creating the change that is desperately needed. More progress must be made. It is our duty.\n"}, "_id": "Coca Cola.txt"}
{"_source": {"content": "In the wake demonstrations calling for justice and reform that highlight the urgent need for systemic change, American Airlines has undertaken deepened discussions with black team members and members of our Black Professional Network EBRG to hear their pain and frustration about the impact systemic racism has in their daily lives. After listening and taking suggestions from across the company, the airline\u2019s senior leadership team issued a letter to all team members outlining the next steps to increase its focus on diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThe tragic deaths of Rayshard Brooks, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery have ignited an overdue reckoning with the brutality and racism that black Americans have dealt with for far too long. Their deaths are not isolated events. The past weeks of demonstrations calling for justice and reform highlight the urgent need for systemic change, because Black Lives Matter.\nWe cannot allow the events of the past few weeks to result in nothing more than outrage, remorse and protests. We must take the energy and awareness created from these tragedies and convert it into meaningful and sustainable change. We must use these events to bring us closer together as a society, not pull us further apart.\nWe recognize these are global problems that have particularly plagued the United States for more than 400 years. We believe very strongly that those who are privileged with leadership have a responsibility to break down barriers to success for those less privileged. Our primary collective responsibility is to ensure that it is the case here at American Airlines. But we also need to use our voices within the business community to encourage and support corporate efforts to eliminate systemic racism in America.\nAs to American Airlines, over the past three years, we\u2019ve taken a number of important steps to increase our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, including hiring our first Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer. Additionally, we established the company\u2019s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to ensure we implement best practices across our business. We\u2019ve delivered implicit bias training for more than 100,000 of our team members and created a specialized customer relations team to listen to, resolve and learn from any customer complaints of discrimination.\nWe\u2019ve been proud of that work, but it\u2019s not enough. Over the past few weeks, we have deepened our discussions with our black team members, including members of our Black Professional Network EBRG, and our customers. Those conversations have led to a series of important suggestions and recommendations in addition to the work that is already underway. Those additional efforts will begin by focusing on three areas.\nContinued listening and relationships\nIn order to move forward, we must begin by taking the time to listen to each other, particularly to our black colleagues and customers. We need both introspection and learning from the experiences of others with open hearts and minds. Trust and relationships are required to both bring communities together and to confront systemic racism.\n\t\u2022\tListening sessions and Town Halls:\u00a0In the coming months, we will be hosting numerous gatherings and listening sessions about race with our team members and the communities across our network. We can\u2019t rely on these important interactions and learnings to take place on their own; we need to provide the forums for them to take place.\n\t\u2022\tCommunity Council:\u00a0In an effort to better serve our customers, we will establish a Community Council, which will be sponsored by President Robert Isom. This newly formed council will be made up of our company\u2019s senior executives and a cross-section of black community leaders who will provide feedback on a variety of company initiatives with a focus on issues impacting the customer travel experience. These community leaders will make recommendations and provide perspectives on the challenges that our black customers face.\n\t\u2022\tAdvocacy efforts:\u00a0We commit to join, lead and support efforts by the business community to address the systemic causes of injustice in the communities we serve and in Washington, D.C.\nContinued learning and aligned values\nWe must provide an inclusive workplace for current and future team members. To that end, we are recommitting ourselves to supporting a culture where all team members are valued and respected. Any incidents of conscious or unconscious bias toward our customers and team members is unacceptable and will be addressed appropriately. Each one of us is accountable for ensuring that our actions \u2014 and those of our fellow team members \u2014 support a culture of inclusion and respect.\n\t\u2022\tPhase 2 of implicit bias training and education:\u00a0It is incumbent upon us to provide additional learning opportunities and implicit bias training to establish cultural expectations for our team members, as well as our leaders. We will continue to provide industry-leading implicit bias training, both in-person and peer-led, as well as through online platforms, and we will seek out new opportunities to bring team members together to learn from each other.\n\t\u2022\tEnhancing our policies:\u00a0We will continue to directly address acts of bias and racism whether in social media or our workplace. In the coming days, we will roll out strengthened policies to provide all team members clear guidance on conduct and consequences for discriminatory and racially biased behavior in the workplace and online.\nIntentional recruitment and advancement\nThe representation of black professionals in our senior leadership is insufficient, and we will do more to change this reality. We acknowledge that a stated aspiration without a goal is ineffective. While our hiring and advancement practices are impacted in the short term by an industry financial crisis, our commitment to diversifying our leadership team over the long term has not changed. We will establish specific objectives and lay out a plan to achieve them.\n\t\u2022\tFocused talent management:\u00a0We\u2019ll accomplish this through enhanced recruiting, development and mentorship. We must become a model company in the way we assess equitable treatment for all employees with regard to pay, advancement, access to development and recognition.\n\t\u2022\tAccess for all:\u00a0We also will assist black youth in developing job skills and expanding access to well-paying careers as part of our overall strategy to expand opportunities in our hub cities and Tulsa. We will establish talent pipelines and apprenticeship programs with community-based organizations. As we return to growing our airline and hiring again, we will do all we can to ensure that young people in communities that have been historically underserved have every opportunity to join our team.\nAs an airline, creating connections is our business, and we exist to bring the world and people closer together. The next phase of our journey begins with specific steps to achieve our aspirations. Rest assured, our commitment to be better \u2014 and to do better \u2014 will be measured by consistent action and progress. The communities and people we serve should expect nothing less from us.\n"}, "_id": "American Airlines.txt"}

This investment will help strengthen small businesses and provide a long-term economic impact vital to the continued development and growth of these communities.\u00a0\nCharter\u2019s Spectrum Community Investment Loan Fund (the Loan Fund) will invest $3 million in NUL\u2019s community development financial institution (CDFI), the Urban Empowerment Fund (UEF), which will make individual loans to minority-owned small businesses and, under the direction of and on behalf of NAN, the Loan Fund will invest an additional $3 million in low-interest loans directly to CDFIs. In addition, Charter will provide $3.5 million in PSA value to promote its partners\u2019 Loan Fund opportunities, and will contribute a $500,000 capacity grant to the NUL for revitalizing its CDFI platform including funding for staffing, infrastructure, and operations.\n\u201cIn all communities, small business ownership and growth are fundamental to developing and sustaining economic power, which is critical to their long-term success,\u201d said Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO of Charter Communications. \u201cBuilding on our valued partnerships with the National Urban League and National Action Network, these investments will support small diverse-owned businesses through access to much-needed low-interest capital and help build thriving communities across the country.\u201d\nThe NUL\u2019s small business lending subsidiary, UEF, provides loans and coaching to minority-owned businesses that provide jobs and revenue to economically distressed areas and other underserved communities.\u00a0\n\"Small Black-owned businesses, a primary economic driver in Black neighborhoods, are less likely to be approved for loans than their White-owned counterparts, and when they are approved, they receive smaller amounts and at higher interest rates,\u201d said Marc H. Morial, National Urban League President and CEO. \u201cAs we face the most daunting economic landscape since the Great Depression, committed and enlightened partners like Charter are more valued than ever before. Charter is helping the National Urban League build stronger and more stable communities that create opportunity for prosperity.\"\n\u201cIn order to achieve the economic equality we want to see, we need to support our Black businesses and our Black entrepreneurs,\u201d said Reverend Al Sharpton. \u201cFor too long, our talented Black communities have been deprived of low interest loans, capital and a myriad of resources to help Black businesses thrive and prosper, a reality that has lasted decades inhibiting us from playing and competing in a level playing field. This partnership is one more step to address the systemic scarcity in our communities and to underscore much needed investment to turn the tide of inequity.\u201d\u00a0\nIn February, Charter launched the Loan Fund committing to invest an initial $10 million in capital by the end of 2021 by making low-interest loans through CDFIs to small businesses whose goods and services help meet core needs in underserved communities within Charter\u2019s 41-state operating footprint. With the addition of the investment partnerships with the NUL and NAN, Charter\u2019s Loan Fund commitment has increased to $13 million, and the NUL UEF investment represents the fourth made by the Loan Fund in the past four months. Charter previously announced $1 million investments in Pursuit Community Finance in New York, PeopleFund in Texas, and the\u00a0Economic and Community Development Institute (ECDI)\u00a0in Ohio. Over the next year, the Loan Fund expects to invest an additional $4 million across CDFIs in California, Florida, North Carolina and Wisconsin, in addition to the $3 million into CDFIs as directed by NAN.\nIn addition to the loans, each CDFI receives a grant to fund technical assistance programs and professional training for small businesses to help establish sound business practices necessary for long-term growth and continuity.

And sometimes it is reflected into the world \u2013 what can we do as a company to accelerate the change we desire? As we see the everyday racism, bias and violence experienced by the Black and African American community, the tragic and horrific murders of so many, the violence in cities across the US, it is time for us to act in all arenas. As I shared in\u00a0our\u00a0Employee Town Hall\u00a0last week, each of us \u2013 starting with me and the senior leaders at the company \u2013 has a role to play. We cannot episodically wake up when a new tragedy occurs. A systemic problem requires a holistic response.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am heartbroken by the deep pain our communities are feeling. The results of systemic racism, which have impacted opportunities and exacerbated injustices for Black and African American communities, urge me to consider my own role as a leader. I must continue my journey of understanding and empathy and examine actions I take, or don\u2019t take, every day.

I ask each of us to recommit to our shared D&I priority, participate in our inclusion learning programs, use the tools and resources we have shared on becoming an\u00a0effective ally\u00a0for others. We have the capabilities to make Microsoft more diverse and inclusive, but we must do the work.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe also have a responsibility to use our platform and resources intentionally to address systemic inequities in our communities and in society broadly. This is the work we need to do to have lasting impact. For example, we\u2019re using our technology and our voice toward a more equitable criminal justice system with\u00a0our\u00a0Criminal Justice Reform Initiative. We created our Supplier Diversity program 15 years ago, so our supplier companies better reflected the diversity of our customers. Today, it makes up nearly 10 percent of our supplier spend. That spend has an amplifying effect, growing the local economies in the communities where those businesses are located. We need to keep building on this work in every community we operate in.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\nFinally, we must carry our company values out into the world in a way that reflects our strengths and expertise. To this end, we will deepen our engagement with six organizations that are advancing social justice, helping community organizers address racial inequality, and offering solidarity to the Black community:\u00a0Black Lives Matter Foundation,\u00a0Equal Justice Initiative,\u00a0Innocence Project,\u00a0The Leadership\u00a0Conference,\u00a0Minnesota Freedom Fund, and\u00a0NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund. This starts with a company donation of $250,000 to each of these organizations ($1.5 million in total), followed by a company match of our employees\u2019 contributions to eligible organizations.\u00a0Together, through your giving and the company match, we have donated more than $15 million to civil rights, social action, and advocacy nonprofit organizations since 2015.\nI have heard from many employees over the past several days, expressing calls for action, calls for reflection, calls for change. My response to all of you is this: Yes. We\u00a0have to\u00a0act. And our actions must reflect the values of our company and be directly informed by the needs of the Black and African American community. We must continue to nurture the energy and passion that the Blacks at Microsoft employee resource group fueled in all of us since\u00a0its\u00a0founding in 1989. We have been on a cultural transformation journey and must accelerate our pace of change. Each of us, starting with me, must look at where we are as individuals, confront our fixed mindset and act. Our humanity is what calls out to us to make the world a better place.\u00a0\nWe all have a role to play. I will do the work. The company will do the work. I am asking each of you to do the work. And together, we will help make the difference we want to see in the world.\u00a0\n\u00a0Satya\u00a0\n"}, "_id": "Microsoft.txt"}
{"_source": {"content": "Confronting racism head-on\nWe are listening, learning and acting.\nJune 10, 2020\u00a0in\u00a0Community\nA little over a week ago, after seeing George Floyd die under the knee of a police officer in Minneapolis, I posted my reaction to his death, my condemnation of discrimination and harassment, and my expectation that Boeing and its leaders will have zero tolerance for bigotry of any kind in this company.\nYour response to that message has been overwhelming. Many of you expressed your appreciation. Some shared deeply moving stories about the effect of discrimination in your own lives. A few frankly questioned the commitment of the company to the values I expressed.\nBut I was most affected by the large number of you who wanted to see us \u2014 and me \u2014 do more.\nI\u2019ve read your responses. I\u2019ve listened carefully in numerous talks with Boeing people all over the enterprise, in lengthy discussions with my executive team last week, and in conversations with my counterparts at other companies.\u00a0\nI am proud of Boeing leaders\u2019 commitment to this and the progress we have made over the years. \u00a0\nBut all my conversations over the last two weeks have reinforced for me an obvious point: What\u2019s happening across the U.S. now goes beyond discrimination and harassment, beyond diversity and inclusion. What we\u2019re seeing is the ongoing human cost of historic and persistent racial inequality in the United States.\nAnd a second obvious point: As a company and as human beings, we need to work even harder at doing something about it.\nBoeing has long been committed to the principles of diversity and inclusion, and the efforts we have made \u2014 often quietly and behind the scenes \u2014 have been meaningful.\nBut here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do to take that commitment to the next level:\n\t\tWe\u2019re going to turn up the volume on dialogue within the company. I am encouraging all Boeing leaders to engage on this subject in a way that is authentic to them and meaningful to the people they lead. These won\u2019t be \u2014 in fact should\u00a0not\u00a0be \u2014 comfortable discussions. Earlier today, we rolled out a conversation guide for leaders and other resources to help you through them.\n\t\tWe\u2019re going to redouble our determination to drive out behaviors that violate our values and injure our colleagues. For anyone wondering what that means, here\u2019s an example: About 10 days ago a Boeing employee made an abusive and harassing racial remark to a colleague in one of our facilities. He was quickly suspended, never returned to the workplace, and is no longer a Boeing employee. When these things happen, you will know about them. I am always transparent and will be so especially on the subject of prejudice.\n\t\tWe are going to strengthen our expectations for living our values at Boeing by raising the bar for progress on key measures of equity and opportunity for our people \u2014 and making ourselves accountable for clearing that bar.\n\t\tOver the next four years we\u2019re going to double the $25 million we have already invested in partnerships that create a range of opportunities for marginalized communities.\n\t\tWe\u2019re going to reach out to other companies on ways to drive broad and consistent change across our industry.\nEvery member of my team has committed personally to confronting racism and building more inclusive opportunities \u2014 both inside our company and in our communities. That means, among other things, understanding more about the role that law enforcement and the criminal justice system can play in overcoming, not perpetuating, the unfair gap that divides the experience of our black colleagues and neighbors from the rest of us.\nThis is not an issue of the week or the month or even the year. These commitments will be an even more permanent and visible aspect of how Boeing conducts itself as a company. It\u2019s the part we can play in capturing this moment to help solve a problem that has for so long prevented our society from being as inclusive and just as it should be.\nStay safe.\nDave\n"}, "_id": "Boeing.txt"}

Through the Cigna Foundation, we will continue to make grants available and convene a broad range of stakeholders \u2013 businesses, government entities, nonprofits, providers, delivery systems and community residents \u2013 all in an effort to eliminate barriers to health and improve access to care. This includes addressing needs amplified by COVID-19, such as food insecurity and mental health through our\u00a0Healthier Kids For Our Future\u00ae\u00a0program that specifically focus on the needs of our children. Additionally, we have been actively engaged with Congress and the Administration in efforts to address and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health care delivery and outcomes. We will continue to use our seat at the table to share insights and solutions that address social determinants of health and improve our results to strengthen the health of all communities. For more information on our efforts to combat health disparities, please see our 2019 corporate responsibility report,\u00a0Cigna Connects.\n\t\u2022\tExpand Cigna's Health Equity Council.\u00a0Our team of multi-disciplinary leaders has collaborated on research, testing and solutions to prevent chronic diseases and improve health outcomes in minority communities since 2008. We will further accelerate these efforts to address clinical care, social determinants of health and health behaviors.\nImprove Well-Being\nRacism and bias not only impact health; they take a toll on overall well-being.\u00a0 We believe that it is critical that no one feels the need to confront racism and bias alone and that everyone feels safe in their environment.\u00a0 Therefore, as part of our program, we are taking the following actions:\n\t\u2022\tStanding Together. We are inviting our 75,000+ employees to sign a commitment to embody inclusive behavior in their professional and personal lives.

We will now require unconscious bias training for all employees, and are planning cultural competency training for all managers, as a supplement to our existing training requirements. We will also continue to advance authentic and inclusive conversations about systemic racism in America. For example, in June, over 8,000 Cigna employees joined virtual, safe space facilitated discussions, which are now offered regularly. Additionally, we partnered with\u00a0DiversityInc\u00a0for a virtual panel on systemic racism in our communities, which was attended by more 12,300 clients and partners. The replay is available\u00a0here.\nImprove Peace of Mind\nWe recognize that financial health is a key element of peace of mind and that racism has a negative economic impact on people of color. We are taking steps to advance a positive trend for current and future generations by:\n\t\u2022\tCreating Educational Opportunities. Education is the path to economic prosperity for many. Cigna is partnering with\u00a0Howard University\u00a0and the School Superintendent Association to bolster the effectiveness of school district leadership in our nation's urban areas by funding fellowships for those on a career path to becoming an urban public school superintendent. We are also furthering\u00a0Cigna Scholars, a program assisting dependents and grandchildren of employees who plan to pursue post-secondary or vocational education.\n\t\u2022\tPromoting Equity and Equality in Career Advancement.\u00a0We are committed to compensating our employees equitably and competitively, regardless of race, gender, age or sexual orientation. We will continue to proactively monitor our compensation programs for potential disparities, including conducting a regular annual review of pay equity, and diligently addressing disparities as warranted. Additionally, we will continue to support our mentoring program, including a key focus on creating cross-cultural pairings; we are committed to achieving increased diversity among leadership across the enterprise.\n\t\u2022\tSupporting Minority Businesses. We are on track to achieve\u00a0$1 billion\u00a0in diverse supplier funding by 2025.

{"_source": {"content": "A Message From Our CEO\nThis message was shared with all MassMutual employees on June 1.\nDear Colleagues,\nIn response to the racist acts that have come to light over the past several weeks, I wanted to directly address the deep frustration, anger, and sadness that is weighing heavily on all of us, especially the African American and Black community. The tragic and senseless deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and the delays in bringing justice against those responsible, as well as the ugly confrontation in Central Park, have been vivid reminders of the prejudice and bigotry that continue to exist in our country.\nImportantly, while we mourn for each of these victims, our hearts ache for many others previously killed under similar circumstances, including those whose names we don\u2019t know, simply because there was no video or witness. These losses of human lives are staggering, unjust and incomprehensible \u2013 and are taking a painful, emotional toll on our country.\nThe violence and riots of the past weekend are symptoms of the deeper issues of racism, inequality, and hopelessness that continue to exist in America today, and reflect the expressions of a community that feels its voice is not being heard. These issues have shaped everything from where people live, to the health care they receive, to their access to education, and to their treatment by the justice system. We see the results of this today during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people of color have shouldered a far greater impact, with the African American and Black community accounting for a higher proportion of deaths compared to other racial groups.\nThis is a vast, systemic problem, and I wish I was writing to you today with a crisp, detailed plan for how we will fix it. I don\u2019t have this plan, and frankly no one does. But I can tell you instead what MassMutual is doing and what is on my mind.\nFirst and foremost, I want to voice my \u2013 and the executive leadership team\u2019s \u2013 support for our colleagues in the African American and Black community. Your voices, perspectives, and feelings matter to us. While I can\u2019t begin to understand the full extent of your pain and hurt \u2013 how fear and discrimination are part of your everyday activities, or how you may worry as a parent when your child goes for a jog or enters a store \u2013 I want you to know we firmly stand with you as allies and advocates. Each of us can make a difference simply by asking how others are doing and spending time listening to their experiences, fears, and concerns, so we can learn more about what we can do as allies to take meaningful action and offer our support.\nSecondly, at the heart of who we are and who we have been since our founding nearly 170 years ago is a company of people helping people. I want to reiterate that MassMutual\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion is non-negotiable, and part of our core values and our promise to Live Mutual to make our world better. We will honor the memories of the victims of these senseless acts by influencing real change, and we are working with a cross-functional team, including representatives from our Passages Business Resource Group, to identify the best way to engage and act as an organization to advance how we address these complex issues.\nMost immediately, Passages will host a Brave Space discussion on Friday to talk about these recent events and consider ways we can work together to build a sustainable, lasting effort to fight inequality and recognize and value the differences among us. While outside our walls, we are also actively working to unify business leaders to use our collective voices to drive change in our communities and workplaces.\nIn the meantime, I promise you this: MassMutual will stand with the victims of racism and hate crimes of any kind, with the people fighting oppression, and with everyone seeking to turn their sadness at recent events into actions that will build a better world. This is not the country I want to leave to my children and grandchildren. We can \u2013 and must \u2013 do better.\nSincerely,\n"}, "_id": "MassMutual.txt"}

As someone who started his education at a segregated elementary school, I\u2019ve experienced first-hand the progress we\u2019ve made.

Many in our society, and many at Freddie Mac, are deeply pained and upset by these events. I am one of them.\nAs I noted in a message to all our employees last week, it is of utmost importance that we listen, learn and respond to the voices leading this conversation. We strongly stand behind those who have spoken out in support of fairness, equality and a more just society.\nFreddie Mac strives to be a leader in housing. That means\u00a0recognizing\u00a0that, like the broader financial system, the housing system in America has also been afflicted by the scourge of entrenched racism and discrimination. \u00a0\nEven during the current pandemic, the disproportionate impact to the Black community has been self-evident. While Black Americans represent 13 percent of the population, they account for about 23 percent of deaths from COVID-19, due to conditions largely created by unequal economic, housing, environmental and health care systems. Clearly, there is much work to be done.\nIn light of these challenges, companies like Freddie Mac have an obligation not only to call out and speak out against these inequities but also show through our actions that we are committed to change. As a majority-minority company, and one so critical to the nation\u2019s housing landscape, we have been engaging in conversations across our company to ensure we are becoming better educated on the topic of race and helping to heal the underlying issues of inequality in housing. And I fundamentally believe that our company is and can be an even greater force for good in addressing these challenges.\nFreddie Mac has worked hard for decades to carry out its mission of expanding homeownership opportunities and access to affordable rental housing for underserved borrowers, including and especially communities of color. We take our obligation to do more in terms of access and opportunity seriously.\nWe are redoubling our efforts to work with our strong network of partners at civil rights organizations, affinity groups within the company and housing industry organizations that represent communities of color to better meet the needs of the populations they serve. In all economic environments, we continue to make home possible for tens of thousands of homebuyers and renters across all dimensions, including race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and ability. That includes first-time and low-income owners, low-income renters, and families living in underserved communities across the United States. And we remain committed to embedding diversity and inclusion in every corner of the business and the industry, including our hiring and vendor practices. \u00a0\nThere are no easy answers as to what policies or actions we should undertake that could bring lasting change. But we know that we cannot effectively help heal the nation\u2019s wounds without using our diverse and inclusive culture to build a company that is better educated about issues of racial injustice and is committed to addressing the inequities in housing.\nOur responsibility starts at our front door.\n"}, "_id": "Freddie Mac.txt"}
{"_source": {"content": "There is no question these last few weeks, months and even this past year have been incredibly difficult as we have seen the systems of our daily lives and ideas of what we had considered \u201cnormal\u201d disappear. The successive battles of COVID-19, the resulting economic contraction and job losses, and our own reckoning with deep-rooted systemic racism and bigotry have brought to light centuries of inequality, injustice, and fragility underpinning our society for far too long. It is clear to me that our notions of corporate social responsibility, advocacy or even the most recent notion of stakeholder capitalism simply aren\u2019t doing enough to care for our world.\nWhen we first began to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked ourselves, \u201cwhat more can we do?\u201d Each of us knows the familiar and comfortable playbook of donating funds and releasing a statement of solidarity. Every dollar certainly matters. At Cisco, we have done our fair share of giving \u2013 whether it be the first $50 million we committed to solving homelessness in Silicon Valley in 2018 or the initial $225 million in COVID-19 global response we committed in March which we have grown to over $500 million today. But what happens when we take it beyond our financial means and put all the might of what makes Cisco unique towards fighting a pandemic or centuries of systemic racism?\nOver the past year, we have been thinking a lot about the purpose of our organization and the work we do with our customers and partners. In our early days, we set out to change the way the world worked, lived, played and learned by building networks that have shaped the Internet we know today. This work is now ensuring billions of peoples\u2019 curbside pickups, grocery deliveries, telehealth visits, digital payments, and Webex meetings work flawlessly. So, what comes next? We know our responsibilities don\u2019t end with technology. It\u2019s now about making the world we envision possible. Over the past six months, we came to the conclusion that our new purpose is to Power an Inclusive Future for All.\nWe can achieve this purpose through our technology, our actions and our intentions. As we grappled with COVID-19, we developed a new framework for how we will guide our decisions in how we respond to what we see as a crisis, an injustice or a global challenge. This is anchored by four primary pillars of response:\n\t\u2022\tThe Most Vulnerable, led by Tae Yoo, SVP, Corporate Affairs, will focus on the non-profits and partners that support underserved communities and those disproportionately impacted by systemic issues and crises.\n\t\u2022\tFamilies and Community, led by Fran Katsoudas, EVP and Chief People Officer, will focus on expanding care and well-being services beyond our employees.\n\t\u2022\tResearch and Resilience, led by Liz Centoni, SVP Emerging Technologies & Incubation, will focus on technology solutions that can advance healthcare research and address social inequities.\n\t\u2022\tStrategic Recovery, led by Maria Martinez, EVP and Chief Customer Experience Officer, will focus on helping healthcare and education institutions adapt their operations so they can continue to provide care to impacted communities and critical pathways to job opportunities during times of uncertainty.\nAs we rise to challenges going forward, we will use this framework as a holistic approach to make sure our efforts are not \u201cone and done\u201d and drive impact at an individual level. We commit to thinking beyond the initial response and utilizing all of our resources and capabilities to truly work towards long-term partnerships and solutions that make peoples\u2019 lives better.\nAll of us are impacted by the choices we make and the events that are thrust upon us, but it is our intent and our actions that set us apart. At Cisco Live in 2016 \u2013 with many of you \u2013 we announced our goal of positively impacting one billion people by 2025. While we are well on our way, having impacted 469 million in just the first four years, I believe this new framework and our continued partnerships will only accelerate this journey.\nWe are at a critical moment in history and so much is within our ability to shape it. As businesses, we have an opportunity to do way more for the world than we thought possible and I look forward to you joining us. I have been so inspired by the heroic actions and faces of hope around the world. I believe we can use this opportunity \u2013 and this week \u2013 to come together and achieve what we know is possible.

Tragically, this is a trend that did not start in the past few weeks. George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Christian Cooper are just the latest victims in a long series of horrific incidents that indicate we still have a very long way to go as a nation to ensure that the human rights of all people are respected equally and that all are able to go about their lives without fearing for their safety because of the color of their skin.\nClearly, these and similar events are not consistent with our values as a company, nor are they consistent with my personal values.

And we can control how we treat each other.\nFor anyone who is feeling anxious in this environment, for whatever reason, please know that I and your leaders are here to listen and to help. You are not alone. Reach out to us, to our colleague networks and to our colleague relations team, as well as take advantage of our Healthy Minds resources that are available.\nAmerican Express colleagues have proven through the current health crisis that we have each other\u2019s backs. Now is the time to stand up for our African American colleagues and let them know we are here for them.

{"_source": {"content": "An Open Letter to Our Federal, State and Local Elected Officials\nBy Randall Stephenson\u2028AT&T Chairman and CEO\nOne cannot read the founding documents of our nation and miss the overarching mandate for justice.\u00a0\nThe first sentence of the preamble to the U.S. Constitution states its very intent is to\u00a0\u201cestablish justice and insure domestic tranquility.\u201d\u00a0 The sequencing of these intentions is patently clear: tranquility flows from justice, not the other way around.\nThe horrific deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and now Rayshard Brooks provide stark evidence that we have failed in our mandate to establish equal justice for Black Americans.\u00a0 And all too often, tragedies like these follow a predictable pattern: Outrage yields to protest, which leads to promises of reform. But in the end, little changes and the pattern repeats itself.\nBut this time feels different.\nIn that spirit, I agreed to represent AT&T and work on equitable justice as part of a new Business Roundtable committee of large company CEOs committed to advance racial equity and justice. While my effort will focus on the immediately pressing issue of needed changes in policing practices, the BRT has initiated projects addressing racial inequality across a broad range of areas including: health and the disparate impact the pandemic has inflicted on Black communities; financial systems; and education and workforce development.\nTo better understand the issues specific to equitable justice, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the past week listening to civil rights leaders and activists, current and former elected officials, religious leaders, and law enforcement professionals to gain insight and direction.\nWhile there are no simple solutions and opinions remain divided on some issues, they all agree that we are in a unique moment in time.\u00a0 And our conversations give me conviction that we have the mandate, the will, and the ability to achieve equitable policing and redefine the relationship between law enforcement and those they serve \u2014 Black Americans, in particular.\nIt\u2019s often easier to affect change locally first, as evidenced by cities like Dallas, San Francisco and Chicago which have already taken decisive steps to change police department practices.\u00a0\nIn Dallas, Police Chief Rene\u00e9 Hall has implemented a \u201cduty-to-intervene policy,\u201d ordering her officers to stop other officers when they act inappropriately. And the department is working to enhance transparency and trust by releasing within 24 hours videos of critical incidents.\u00a0\nIn San Francisco, Mayor London Breed has committed to reforms such as banning the use of military grade weapons and ending the practice of asking police officers to intervene in non-criminal activities, such as mental and behavioral health crises.\nIn Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has signaled that the city is laying the foundation for long-term reform. Importantly, she has stressed that improved accountability and the other solutions that citizens and leaders are calling for will require constructive dialogue with police unions.\nBut equitable policing will take more than local solutions in Dallas, San Francisco, and Chicago. Racial injustice affects cities and towns across our nation. Successfully addressing this will require action on the Federal level to achieve full and equal treatment under the law.\nIn corporate America, we operate by the maxim: what gets measured, gets done.\u00a0 We use data to recognize trends, inform our goals, and drive our decision-making and actions.\u00a0 The same analytical rigor can help inform police reform efforts.\nIt\u2019s promising to see strong, bipartisan efforts in Congress to provide for nationwide data tracking and transparency of police misconduct. This will not only better protect our citizens, but also protect the reputation of the majority of professional, dedicated officers who pursue their work with courage and decency every day.\u00a0\nI\u2019m also encouraged by the groundswell of support from police departments and both Republican and Democratic leaders to ban chokeholds. Now it\u2019s time to further codify national standards on the use of force. Every citizen deserves to know exactly what force police officers are allowed and not allowed to use. \u00a0Clear and specific rules are not just about protecting citizens. They\u2019re equally about protecting officers, who should not be left with too little guidance and training to know what\u2019s reasonable in high-pressure and potentially dangerous situations.\nLikewise, we must take a hard look at our prevailing legal precedent that can exempt police officers from civil liability, even for shocking acts of misconduct and excessive force.\u00a0 Known as qualified immunity, this protection is a multifaceted issue with strong opinions from many quarters. But we cannot afford to ignore it simply because it is complex.\u00a0 Our political leaders must debate the merits of any legal structure which distances our police forces from accountability for misconduct.\nConcerning implicit racial biases, all organizations \u2014 including companies and police forces \u2014need to step up and implement more effective training courses to help address biases \u2013 and do so urgently.\nFinally, as we approach law enforcement reform, police unions must be part of the solution.\u00a0 To the extent that collectively bargained practices stand in the way of just treatment for Black Americans, those practices must be on the table.\u00a0 We must commit together to challenge anything which compromises accountability, trust, and confidence in law enforcement.\u00a0 AT&T has one of America\u2019s largest union-represented workforces, so I appreciate this won\u2019t be easy.\u00a0 But America can no longer overlook the extent to which these policies and practices are contributing to unjust treatment.\nThis is America\u2019s moment to seize the opportunity for change and business leaders cannot sit this one out. We must engage to drive reform.\nToday, I feel a sense of renewed hope and resolve that our Constitution\u2019s mandate for justice to ensure domestic tranquility is not simply an ideal \u2026 it can be our reality.\n"}, "_id": "AT&T.txt"}

Mandela, one of my heroes as a native South African, spoke in India in 2004 and called out what so many of us in positions of privilege in the United States are increasingly confronting. That a country where people of color do not and cannot feel safe is not a country at peace. The United States has made progress in our lifetime, but remains in everyday conflict over the fundamental right of equality. It is the responsibility of institutions and individuals with power to support the side of justice in this struggle.\nAmerisourceBergen is guided by our purpose and principles, and unity in our responsibility to create healthier futures necessitates action to address and attack systematic inequality.

We are actively communicating with our associates and ensuring everyone has access to resources and assistance including support for mental health and crisis preparedness.\u00a0\nMuch of the past few weeks has been spent executing on our fundamental role in confronting a global pandemic. Through this global health crisis our organization, on the backs of every one of our 22,000 associates, has persevered and remained hopeful for a return to normal.\u00a0The unacceptable truth that we must confront and work to overcome is that many people, for no other reason than the color of their skin, do not have a normal to return to.\u00a0\nThis absence of safety and equity has simmered for far too long and now after myriad examples of violence against communities of color, peaceful protests have in many cases boiled into destruction on the streets of many cities across the United States and the globe. I know that health care providers that our company supports, many of whom care for vulnerable populations, have been impacted and my sincere hope is that the current violence and unrest can quickly be replaced by acceleration of action and progress towards meaningful equity.\nTo achieve this progress, each of us must live up to our responsibility to work towards true peace. A peace, as Mandela defines, where all can flourish regardless of our beautiful differences.\nThis message was originally shared with all AmerisourceBergen associates on June 1, 2020.

All at once, we are grappling with a public health crisis that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, an economic shock that has forced us to adapt on the fly, and social upheaval that has challenging all of us to think and act differently.\nIn the midst of this, the tragic killing of George Floyd, compounded by other senseless killings over the years, has sparked the expression of decades of collective anger and frustration over the unacceptable abuse of power and authority. This pain is felt across the communities our employees call home.\nThere is no doubt that the weight of these challenges disproportionately fall on the black community. We have seen this disparity among our own Ford team members affected by COVID-19, and the legacy of economic disparities in our own home city of Detroit. It is pain that many of our team members have long felt in their daily lives.\nThere are no easy answers. We are not interested in superficial actions. This is our moment to lead from the front and fully commit to creating the fair, just and inclusive culture that our employees deserve.\nFord, and our labor partners, especially the UAW, have shown leadership on diversity and inclusion over the years. Building on this, and the work of the Ford Motor Company Fund in black communities, there is much more we can do together.\nToday is the start of an even deeper dialogue within Ford on these critical issues. We will be meeting with employees across the company, including engaging with the Ford African Ancestry Network (FAAN). We also plan to ask leaders throughout the company to hold dialogues with their teams to understand how people are feeling and discuss how we can get better together. We promise to share updates as we continue on this journey.\u00a0\nWe are a company made up of extraordinary people of every race, religion, and background, all worthy of the same dignity. We view our differences as one of our great strengths. We are a team \u2013 not in word, but in bond.\nAnd while we would like to say that racism has no place in our society, we know that systemic racism still exists despite the progress that has been made. We cannot turn a blind eye to it or accept some sense of \u201corder\u201d that\u2019s based on oppression.\u00a0\nMany of us cannot know what it is truly like to be part of a community of color, to know what it is like to be afraid for our children every time they leave the house, or to worry that this day might be our last. But as long as so many of our colleagues, our friends, live with that fear, how can we live with ourselves? As long as we have the privilege to breathe, it\u2019s on all of us to summon new levels of empathy and humanity.\nFinally, we want to say to anyone struggling with fear and despair, we have resources that can help. Please visit @FordOnline and see below for more information.\nIn a time of hardship and upheaval, one thing is for certain: we remain a family and a company that is stronger together and committed to racial and social justice.\nThank you for all you do for Ford Motor Company.\nBill and Jim\n"}, "_id": "Ford.txt"}

{"_source": {"content": "Dear colleagues, Over the last few weeks, there has again been civil unrest across the United States, which is spreading to other countries. There is sadness and anger over race-based discriminatory and violent acts, including the senseless deaths of black men and women at the hands of police officers. Issues of diversity and inclusion are important, and basic human and civil rights even more so. We and the other members of the AIG Executive Leadership Team believe it is necessary to address the situation. At AIG we strive to be a market leader \u2013 not only in our core businesses, but as an employer that values the contributions of all colleagues regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age or sexual orientation. There is no room for racism or other forms of discrimination at AIG. We stand as Allies with our black colleagues and colleagues who are part of racially mixed families. You are not alone in your heartache. We hear your anguish, see your grief and acknowledge your pain. Our company operates in many countries around the world and we draw strength from the diversity of our colleague base. We know that diverse and inclusive organizations are healthier and perform better. Our response to COVID-19 is an example of how when we come together, united against a common enemy, we are unstoppable in helping each other, our clients and other stakeholders. We have made strides at AIG to build a diverse and inclusive global team of professionals, but we know there is still much work to be done. The last few days, in particular, have been a painful reminder that there must be a deeper and more robust dialogue about our values, and we must live those values, as well as continue our efforts to foster a diverse and respectful work environment. We are committed to speaking up and calling out injustice. We need your help. Each and every one of us has a role to play if we are to become a true leader in our industry \u2013 on all issues, not just financial results, operational excellence or stock price. Starting today, we must come together with compassion and take more meaningful action that will contribute to lasting change when it comes to eradicating racism and inequality. As an initial statement of our support for the black community, the AIG Foundation will make a US$250,000 donation to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and a US$250,000 donation to Amnesty International. In addition, each colleague globally will receive an additional paid day off to volunteer for an organization that focuses on education about the importance of equality, diversity, inclusion, criminal justice reform, and human and civil rights, or otherwise provides support for underrepresented and at-risk groups. With the help of leaders and managers across the organization, we also plan to create more opportunities for open dialogue about issues of racism, discriminatory behavior and unconscious bias. These can be uncomfortable conversations, but they pale in comparison to the conversation colleagues have with their black parents, siblings or children as they fear for their safety and seek acceptance in society. Together we will build a better, stronger, more inclusive and unified company. Thank you for your continued dedication and commitment to AIG. "}, "_id": "AIG.txt"}
{"_source": {"content": "As people around the world demand justice for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and far too many others, we have been thinking hard about how PepsiCo can help dismantle the systemic racial barriers that for generations have blocked social and economic progress for Black people in this country. We know that the first step toward change is to speak up, so I want to be very clear: Black Lives Matter, to our company and to me.\nEven though I wasn\u2019t born in the United States, I am passionate about this issue. Growing up in Spain, my parents raised me to believe that all people are equal, that diversity is a reflection of our common humanity. This is true both in companies and the larger society. Yet despite my parents\u2019 optimistic view, we know that all people are not treated equally and that the problem of systemic racism is very real. The struggle for equality exists in many forms around the world, from religious freedom, to gender equality, indigenous people\u2019s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, Latino rights in the U.S., and other racial and ethnic discrimination. After living in Georgia and Connecticut for several years, I have come to better understand the urgent need for racial and social justice in this nation, and I am committed to using my position as CEO to lead this change.\nA letter I received recently from a long-time PepsiCo associate expressed some of the pain many of our colleagues feel. She spoke of Black Americans\u2019 struggle with everything from sub-standard housing, to racial profiling, to under-funded education. She was disappointed in some of PepsiCo\u2019s past decisions and called us to action, saying: \u201cPepsiCo at this time has an opportunity to look at our African American employees and community with wide open eyes and heart, and to work hand-in-hand to address the plagues many of us all too often face each day.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more.\nDuring the past few weeks, the senior leadership team and I have been doing a lot more listening than talking. I met with several different groups of Black community leaders, as well as MOSAIC, our Black employee resource group. These conversations were humbling and enlightening. I came away from them more conscious of the insidious nature of systemic racism and even more committed to using PepsiCo\u2019s resources for good.\nThe journey for racial equality has long been part of our company\u2019s DNA, going back to our first Black sales team in 1947 and the legacy of Harvey Russell. We\u2019ve also been long-time contributors to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and will continue to support their work for social justice. But the recent protests in all 50 states and around the world have called on us to honestly assess our efforts. Whilst there are areas we have made progress in the fight against systemic racism and inequality\u2014including pay equity and the diversity of our frontline workforce\u2014we know we cannot keep pointing to what we did decades ago. The promise of our journey remains unfulfilled. We have much work to do going forward, and to echo Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \u201cThe time is always right to do what is right.\u201d\nSo today, I am announcing the next step in PepsiCo\u2019s journey for racial equality: a more than $400 million set of initiatives over five years to lift up Black communities and increase Black representation at PepsiCo. These initiatives comprise a holistic effort for PepsiCo to walk the talk of a leading corporation and help address the need for systemic change.\nOur journey will now focus on three pillars\u2014People, Business, and Communities.\nWhen it comes to People, we are focusing on increasing representation; recruitment; and education, internships and apprenticeships. That means dramatically rethinking our approach to talent, starting by:\nExpanding our Black managerial population by 30% by 2025 through internal development and recruitment\u2014we will add more than 250 Black associates to managerial roles by 2025, including adding a minimum of 100 Black associates to our executive ranks. Whilst 14% of our U.S. workforce is Black, we know we need to increase representation in leadership.\nAccelerating our recruitment efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and increasing partnerships with diverse organizations at our core schools.\nEstablishing scholarship support for students transitioning from 2-year to 4-year programs and scaling our existing efforts to support trade/certificate and academic 2-year degrees education through community colleges for 400 Black students per year\u2014these funds will also provide wrap-around support, including money for books, transportation, housing, and more.\nActivating associates to help drive ongoing change in our organization, with a focus on internal mentoring, coaching, and continuous development\u2014we know that many of you want to get involved, and we will need your support to see our journey through.\nMandating company-wide unconscious bias training, followed by continued training aimed at reducing biases in the workplace; including PDR objectives on representation; and requiring diversity on executive candidate slates\u2014we\u2019ll also expand our programs dedicated to supporting Black talent throughout critical career stages.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to Business, we will leverage our scale and influence across our suppliers, marketing agency partners and customer base to increase representation and strengthen Black-owned businesses. That means step changes in our spending and approach to partnerships, starting by:\nMore than doubling our spending with Black-owned suppliers; expanding the supplier pipeline through advocacy and outreach; and building supplier capability targeting growth across services, agriculture, sustainable packaging, and operations.\nUsing our buying power to create more jobs for Black creators at our marketing agencies and making them part of our content development\u2014we will implement a Creative Agency Diversity Policy modeled on our existing policy for the selection of legal services, including an annual audit.\u00a0\nInvesting $50 million over five years to strengthen local Black-owned businesses.\nWhen it comes to our Communities, we\u2019re working to drive long-term change by addressing systemic barriers to economic opportunity, investing an incremental $20 million over five years. That means broadly increasing our efforts to create opportunity and advance economic empowerment for Black Americans, starting by:\u00a0\nAccelerating our support for social programs that impact Black communities, including delivering $6.5 million in community impact grants to address systemic issues; investing $1 million to replicate our holistic community support program, Southern Dallas Thrives, in Chicago; expanding our Food for Good initiative providing jobs and access to nutrition to more Black communities; and increasing our contribution to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to support the struggle for social justice.\nSupporting Black-owned restaurants as part of our Small Businesses Program, including mentoring, management training and help obtaining financing.\nInvesting $5 million to launch a Community Leader Fellowship program for Black non-profit CEOs. We will provide grants to participants\u2019 organizations, executive education, and connections to PepsiCo leaders and partners.\nThe bottom line is: this moment calls for big, structural changes, and we\u2019re committed to being agents of that progress. As we continue our journey, we are going to keep listening\u2014to leaders, communities and all of our associates\u2014and we will work to do the right thing. We are committed to this work because we know the American society has placed the burden disproportionately on Black people. Injustice and inequality are problems for us all, and we all must do our part to defeat them. These efforts will also inform and positively impact our broader diversity efforts beyond our Black associates, as we look to be an actor in addressing other types of inequality going forward.\nThank you to everyone who has voiced their opinion fearlessly to advance this important conversation. I hear you loud and clear and, as CEO, I aspire to ensure that all associates are proud to work at PepsiCo. We still have a ways to go, but our journey is gathering speed. Together, I am confident we can work to build a stronger, better company that actively supports racial equality, more fully serves our communities, and lives up to our highest ideals.\n"}, "_id": "Pepsico.txt"}

Among them is showing respect and treating everyone with care and consideration. Our C-Suite consists of 38% ethnically diverse leaders, and we continue to focus on enabling diversity at all levels of leadership \u2013 from the Board of Directors, to our Executive Council and our senior leadership ranks.\nWe know that diversity can\u2019t be enabled at the leadership levels without structural focus at every level of the organization. We have instituted procedures across the employee life cycle to ensure equal opportunities for all: we are committed to diverse talent slates during the hiring process, we ensure our candidate review and selection efforts address and reduce unconscious bias, we provide specialized mentorship programs for diverse colleagues to support their career journey and acceleration, and we have a dedicated talent review program to ensure we fully support advancement of colleagues from underrepresented backgrounds.\nHow can ADM ensure people of color are successful?\nApolaro:\nAt ADM we want to remove every potential barrier to successful career journeys for people of color, while ensuring they have the full support of our organization to succeed while bringing their \u201cwhole selves\u201d to the workplace. Every year we take our global workforce through required trainings, including an unconscious bias course to ensure that every colleague has a common understanding of what diversity and inclusion looks like in action and why it matters.\nADM is committed to developing all colleagues and helping them maximize their career aspirations through continuous learning and by providing unique experiences over and above their formal role. Every single colleague at ADM is required to have a development plan that is discussed at least on a quarterly basis. We also have talent talks to discuss the careers of all colleagues to ensure we have the right people in the right jobs to maximize their potential and performance.\nOur Global Tuition Program is available for all colleagues that pursue professional development by reimbursing 75 percent of all eligible tuition, books and mandatory fees for certificates, undergraduate and some graduate level courses. We also provide an independent and confidential compliance hotline, allowing all our employees to freely and confidentially bring up concerns enabling ADM to take appropriate measures to ensure equal opportunities for all.\nWhat action is ADM taking as a result of the protests?\nApolaro:\nIt is an important moment to reinforce communicating our core values surrounding diversity and inclusion, condemning social injustice. We have the personal commitment of our board, CEO and executive committee to engage quickly and transparently on this matter \u2013 and all these groups have taken action over the past several days to host forums for listening, discussion and learning.\nWe are enhancing the amount of pulse surveying we do across the organization to ensure we are listening to and hearing the voices of all colleagues. What we learn from these engagements will set a course for what we must do next.\nHow does ADM support social justice through partnerships and contributions?\nApolaro:\nTo promote substantive change, ADM recently contributed $200,000 to the\u00a0National Urban League, an organization dedicated to advancing economic empowerment, equality and social justice. Their mission is to help African-Americans and others in underserved communities achieve true social parity, economic self-reliance, power, and civil rights.\nOur longstanding partnership with the organization helps support economic empowerment through education and job training, housing and community development, workforce development, entrepreneurship, health, and quality of life. Further, to strengthen our commitment, ADM is matching colleague contributions to approved 501(c)(3) organizations that are supporting causes associated with racial equality.\nThroughout our history, we\u2019ve fostered an environment of respect and integrity, and we realize this must exist beyond the walls of our facilities and weave into the communities we serve.

But I do know that treating people with respect, creating a safe environment, and seeking to understand form the basis for trust, and that enables each of us to feel a sense of belonging. As parents of two sons, who live to ensure they have a bright future, the stories from moms and dads fearing for their sons are gut wrenching to my wife and me. For anyone feeling a heavy burden, our hearts go out to you.\n\u00a0\nWe are a team at USAA, one that shares a common mission and one that promises to live by our core values of service, loyalty, honesty and integrity. We do many things so well, however we have not found a meaningful way to engage in the courageous conversations around race, gender and orientation bias. The absence of talking about our fears and concerns in real terms limits our ability to be our best. The hurt that people feel today is real, palpable and it won\u2019t simply go away.\n\u00a0\nWords are meaningless without action. I believe that listening to diverse perspectives and summoning the courage to start crucial conversations is the first step in fostering inclusivity and creating environments where each of us feels like we belong. It is something I can do better, and something each of us can do to support each other.\n\u00a0\nUSAA stands with the Black community.\u00a0We have been focused on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace for a long time, but there is more work to do. We remain committed to hiring diverse talent and will continue to encourage employee participation in our eight diversity and inclusion business groups and create forums that promote an engaged workforce. We will model crucial conversations, as demonstrated so well by my USAA teammates\u00a0Renee Horne\u00a0and\u00a0Tony Wells. Both have shared actionable advice and profound insights on separate LinkedIn posts about this important subject.\n\u00a0\nFor hundreds of years, men and women of all backgrounds have fought next to each other and died to ensure we live in a free country. Unfortunately, more than 150 years following the 14th Amendment, racial justice is still something we have to fight for, to ensure each of us can enjoy the hard-fought freedom that our Constitution promises. We can start locally by supporting and respecting each other, harnessing our diverse skills, backgrounds and beliefs, and channeling our collective energy to serve each other.\n\u00a0\nThank you for joining the cause for positive change.\n"}, "_id": "USAA.txt"}

I am both impatient and disgusted by the fact that as a nation, we seem to be placated by the passive discussion of \u201cwhy.\u201d Why does this happen? Why can\u2019t we get to a different place? Why is the response so visceral?\nLet\u2019s stop asking \u201cwhy\u201d and start asking \u201cwhat.\u201d What are we going to do? In this moment, we each must decide what we can do \u2013 individually and collectively \u2013 to drive change\u2026 meaningful, deliberate change. As one of the largest global companies, there is much we can do.\nThere comes a time when we are compelled to stop diagnosing what is wrong and start advocating for what is right. And based on our longstanding values, here is what that looks like:\n1. We commit to inclusion \u2013 that means creating the conditions where every single human who believes in inclusion is welcome within our walls.\n2. We unequivocally condemn intolerance \u2013 that means racism, bigotry, discrimination and any other form of named or unnamed hatred.\n3. We stand up against injustice \u2013 that means taking the risk of expressing an unpopular or polarizing point of view, because complacency and complicity sit in the shadow of silence.\nThis Socrates post may seem more pointed than many of the other topics that I\u2019ve shared. However, in this moment there is no place for ambiguity.\nPutting this in writing is not enough. In addition to affirming the above principles, we are taking immediate action. Effective by the end of this quarter, I am commissioning an Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB) of both internal and external leaders, which I will chair. The initial purpose of the IAB is to consult with SLT [senior leadership team], with the longer term goal of inspiring us to be the most inclusive company in the world.\nCollectively, and in time, we will be part of the change. For now, my personal commitment is to ensure that the leadership of GM, and by extension, the entire GM family, consistently remains aware of our responsibility to bring awareness to injustice. Because awareness leads to dialogue\u2026 dialogue leads to understanding\u2026 and understanding leads to change.\nMary Barra\n"}, "_id": "General Motors.txt"}

The events of the past few days and weeks have caused me to feel range of emotions \u2013 anger, frustration, disappointment and sadness \u2013 knowing that we can do better as a society.\nAhmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. George Floyd. Christian Cooper. We need to know their names. We need to understand their stories.

Not once did I ever feel that my family was not welcome, not respected or not safe in our daily life. Not once did I worry that the color of our skin would carry risk or consequence. Recent events have once again reminded me that my experience is not widely shared by Black Americans, or many others.\nInequality in our society is broadly visible. In fact, it has been woven into the fabric of our culture in many ways we don\u2019t even recognize. We can look no further than the COVID-19 pandemic, which while affecting us all, is taking lives and affecting communities with varying degrees of impact. Black Americans are hardest hit and up to 3-4 times more likely to die from the virus, due to conditions largely created by unequal economic, environmental and health care systems. Hispanic Americans, many of whom work in service industries and roles, have been disproportionately impacted financially. They are not alone as evidenced by the increase in hate speech directed at Asian Americans during the pandemic.\nOur Company is not perfect. Our cities are not perfect. Our country is not perfect. Precisely because of this, we all have work to do. Far too often, the burden of seeking equality rests on the shoulders of those most marginalized. This simply won\u2019t work. The change we need is broad and deep and requires us all to be active \u2013 as friends and colleagues, and as allies and advocates.\nAt P&G, we choose to be a Force for Good and a Force for Growth in full recognition that our success is grounded in the success of our employees, consumers and communities.

Our Black community is hurting, and many of us are searching for ways to stand up for what we believe, and reach out to people we love to show solidarity. Yesterday, I met with a group of our Black leaders to talk about where we go from here and how we can contribute as Google. We discussed many ideas, and we are working through where to put our energy and resources in the weeks and months ahead\u2014I\u2019ll share more on that below.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, I wanted to provide space for us to come together as a community. Today at 1:00pm PDT we\u2019ll be standing together to honor the memories of Black lives lost in an\u00a08 minute and 46 second moment of silence.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe length of the moment of silence represents the amount of time George Floyd suffered before he was killed. It's meant to serve as a visceral reminder of the injustice inflicted on Mr. Floyd and so many others. We acknowledge that racism and violence may look different in different parts of the world, so please use this as a moment to reflect on those who have been lost in your own country or community at a time that works for you. If you would like to share this silent space with your fellow Googlers, join the\u00a0live stream at 1:00 pm PDT today.\u00a0\nComing together as a community and showing support is important, but it isn\u2019t enough. So today, we are announcing a few initial commitments to meet the urgency of the moment.\u00a0\u2028\u2028\n\t\u2022\tWe\u2019ll be giving $12 million in funding to organizations working to address racial inequities. Our first grants of $1 million each will go to our long-term partners at the Center for Policing Equity and the Equal Justice Initiative. And we\u2019ll be providing technical support through our\u00a0Google.org Fellows program. This builds on the $32 million we have\u00a0donated to racial justice\u00a0over the past five years. We\u2019ll also offer $25 million in Ad Grants to help organizations fighting racial injustice provide critical information.\u2028\n\t\u2022\tAs a result of last week\u2019s internal giving campaign, I\u2018m pleased to share that you all have contributed an additional $2.5 million in donations that we\u2019re matching. This represents the largest Googler giving campaign in our company\u2019s history, with both the largest amount raised by employees and the broadest participation. \u00a0\u2028\nSupporting worthy organizations is a step in the right direction, but it is not a replacement for doing the harder work ahead both within and outside of Google. The events of the past few weeks reflect deep structural challenges. We\u2019ll work closely with our Black community to develop initiatives and product ideas that support long-term solutions\u2014and we\u2019ll keep you updated.

{"_source": {"content": "We are, I believe, in one of the toughest times in our country\u2019s history, as we continue to battle a deadly pandemic and the resulting economic havoc while, once again, coming face-to-face with the long-term effects of racial injustice. Watching tens of thousands take to the streets to speak out against fear and inhumanity is, on one hand, inspiring for the commitment it represents and, on the other, heartbreaking for its profound need.\nBut what\u2019s next? What do we do to change the cycle in which black men or women, with tragic frequency, are harmed by those who are supposed to protect them? Or the gut-wrenching truth that to be a person of color in America is often to not feel fully safe, seen or heard? \u00a0\nFor me, it starts with seeing the situation for what it is, acknowledging these experiences for what they are and, quite simply, apologizing for not doing enough. As important, it includes committing the company I lead down a path of systemic, permanent change in as many ways as we can find.\nI don\u2019t have the answers, but I am no longer OK with not asking the question: If everything were on the table, what could Best Buy do? With that in mind, I am appointing a diverse group (by demography and level in the company) to challenge one another and, ultimately, our senior leadership team and Board of Directors, with substantive, enduring ways we can address the inequities and injustices to which all of us bear witness every day. \u00a0\nIn many ways, we have engaged in these issues for years. We have long been focused on the opportunity gap and its companion, the digital divide. More than a decade ago we began building a national network of what we call\u00a0Teen Tech Centers, places where teens from disinvested communities are exposed to and trained on a range of technology that, we now know, can make a critical difference in helping them find success in post-secondary education or the job market.\nWe are looking to create more than 100 of these centers, open year-round and typically hosting hundreds of young people who begin in middle school and leave when they graduate high school. We do not do this alone, of course, as our employees, vendor partners and dozens of nonprofits are actively engaged in bringing this mission to life.\nAdditionally, we have brought our resources to bear on the issue of remote learning. In our home state of Minnesota, we helped found a public-private effort to provide computers and internet access to hundreds of thousands of youth from disinvested communities who have neither. Without this technology, learning from home, should it be necessary this fall and winter, would be impossible, widening both the digital divide and opportunity gap.\nThis effort is reflective of our broader view that we must continue to be an important player in the communities we are a part of, especially those hardest hit. This includes continuing to serve the neighborhoods in which our stores were damaged.\u00a0\nAs for those who rely on us the most \u2014 our employees \u2014 we continue to focus on their safety. Just as we did in response to the pandemic, we closed some stores around the country when we felt the risk was too high. Some remain closed, and any affected employee will be paid for their time. As always, no one is compelled to come back to work if they feel uncomfortable.\nNeighborhoods across America have felt the heat of flames lit by those who would do only harm, and still others have felt the fear that comes from not knowing where that harm may go next. But those fires will be extinguished, and the damage will be repaired. What remains, however, are the indelible images of George Floyd and the many who came before him. It is in their name that we embrace the fight for equality and justice as a common cause, one we all fight \u2014 and solve \u2014 together.\nThank you.\n"}, "_id": "Best Buy.txt"}
{"_source": {"content": "I just shared the following note with our employees, and I want to share it with all of you as well.\n---\nAs we continue to process this difficult moment, I want to acknowledge the real pain expressed by members of our community. I also want to acknowledge that the decision I made last week has left many of you angry, disappointed and hurt. So I am especially grateful that, despite your heartfelt disagreement, you remain focused on taking positive steps to move forward. That can't be easy, so I just want to say I hear you and I'm grateful.\nI believe our platforms can play a positive role in helping to heal the divisions in our society, and I'm committed to making sure our work pulls in this direction. To all of you who have already worked tirelessly on ideas to improve, I thank you. You're making a difference, and together we'll make a difference. And while we will continue to stand for giving everyone a voice and erring on the side of free expression in these difficult decisions -- even when it's speech we strongly and viscerally disagree with -- I'm committed to making sure we also fight for voter engagement and racial justice too.\nMany of you have asked what concrete steps we can start working on to improve our products and policies. I want to share more about the seven areas I discussed at Q&A that we're focusing on initially. Based on feedback from employees, civil rights experts and subject matter experts internally, we're exploring the following areas, which fit into three categories: ideas related to specific policies, ideas related to decision-making, and proactive initiatives to advance racial justice and voter engagement. I want to be clear that while we are looking at all of these areas, we may not come up with changes we want to make in all of them. \nIdeas related to specific policies:\n1. We're going to review our policies allowing discussion and threats of state use of force to see if there are any amendments we should adopt. There are two specific situations under this policy that we're going to review. The first is around instances of excessive use of police or state force. Given the sensitive history in the US, this deserves special consideration. The second case is around when a country has ongoing civil unrest or violent conflicts. We already have precedents for imposing greater restrictions during emergencies and when countries are in ongoing states of conflict, so there may be additional policies or integrity measures to consider around discussion or threats of state use of force when a country is in this state.\n2. We're going to review our policies around voter suppression to make sure we're taking into account the realities of voting in the midst of a pandemic. I have confidence in the election integrity efforts we've implemented since 2016. We've played a role in protecting many elections and now have some of the most advanced systems in the world. But there's a good chance that there will be unprecedented fear and confusion around going to the polls in November, and some will likely try to capitalize on that confusion. For example, as politicians debate what the vote-by-mail policies should be in different states, what should be the line between a legitimate debate about the voting policies and attempts to confuse or suppress individuals about how, when or where to vote? If a newspaper publishes articles claiming that going to polls will be dangerous given Covid, how should we determine whether that is health information or voter suppression?\n3. We're going to review potential options for handling violating or partially-violating content aside from the binary leave-it-up or take-it-down decisions. I know many of you think we should have labeled the President's posts in some way last week. Our current policy is that if content is actually inciting violence, then the right mitigation is to take that content down -- not let people continue seeing it behind a flag. There is no exception to this policy for politicians or newsworthiness. I think this policy is principled and reasonable, but I also respect a lot of the people who think there may be better alternatives, so I want to make sure we hear all those ideas. I started meeting with the team yesterday and we're continuing the discussion soon. In general, I worry that this approach has a risk of leading us to editorialize on content we don't like even if it doesn't violate our policies, so I think we need to proceed very carefully.\nIdeas related to decision-making:\n4. We're going to work on establishing a clearer and more transparent decision-making process. This is clearly not the last difficult decision we're going to have to make, and I agree with the feedback from many of you that we should have a more transparent process about how we weigh the different values and equities at stake, including safety and privacy. I think we can provide more transparency into what goes into the policy briefings and recommendations that get sent to me. These analyses are done thoroughly by Monika Bickert's team and take into account many voices. Since I accept the team's recommendations the vast majority of the time, this process is where I think we should focus most on transparency. For the most sensitive escalations where I discuss with the team further rather than just accepting their recommendation over email, we can try to outline how we incorporate all perspectives into those follow-up  discussions as well, even though that tends to vary depending on the equities at stake in each decision.\n5. More broadly, we're going to review whether we need to change anything structurally to make sure the right groups and voices are at the table -- not only when decisions affecting a certain group are being made, but when other decisions that may set precedents are being made as well. I'm committed to elevating the representation of diversity, inclusion and human rights in our processes and management team discussions, and I will follow up soon with specific thoughts on how we can structurally improve this.\nProactive initiatives to advance racial justice and voter engagement:\n6. We've started a workstream for building products to advance racial justice. Many of you have shared ideas in the past few days on product improvements we can look at, and I've been impressed by how quickly we've moved here. I've asked Fidji to be responsible for this work, and Ime will be shifting some volunteers from our New Products Experimentation team to focus on this as well. They'll have more to share on the first set of projects we're planning to take on soon.\n7. We're building a voter hub to double down on our previous get-out-the-vote efforts. At the end of the day, voting is the best way to hold our leaders accountable and address many of these long term questions about justice. Our efforts will draw on lessons we learned from our successful Covid Information Center in order to make our voting and civic engagement efforts as central as our efforts around Covid recovery. We'll focus on making sure everyone has access to accurate and authoritative information about voting, as well as building tools to encourage people to register to vote and help them encourage their friends and communities to vote as well. In 2016, we ran one of the largest get out the vote efforts in history. I expect us to do even better in 2020.\nTo members of our Black community: I stand with you. Your lives matter. Black lives matter. \nWe have so far to go to overcome racial injustice in America and around the world, and we all have a responsibility and opportunity to change that. I believe our platforms will play a positive role in this, but we have work to do to make sure our role is as positive as possible. These ideas are a starting point and I'm sure we'll find more to do as we continue on this journey. I encourage you all to also check out Maxine\u2019s post about how you can give direct feedback on product, integrity and content policy ideas as well. Thanks for all your input so far, and I'm looking forward to making progress together over the coming weeks and months.\n"}, "_id": "Facebook.txt"}

The impact of these events has arrived at our doors.\u00a0 We have closed some facilities on the advice of local law enforcement \u2013 and have seen a few of our stores damaged by rioters.

{"_source": {"content": "A MESSAGE FROM KEN EHLERT, CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER, UNITEDHEALTH GROUP\nWe\u2019ve been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic for several months. Three weeks ago, George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis. Now, global protests are highlighting systemic racism and economic disparity in the U.S. and around the world. Our current reality is filled with disturbing images of unjust behavior, strong emotions and calls for meaningful change.\u2028\nWe know that the same systemic racism and inequities are present in healthcare. COVID-19 has shown the world the rates of disease, hospitalizations, complications and death are higher for Black Americans. But that isn\u2019t new. We\u2019ve known for a long time that diabetes, hypertension, maternal mortality, cancer and other diseases impact Black, Hispanic and Native Americans at higher rates. It would be easy to say this is due to genetic differences or social determinants of health. But that isn\u2019t true. The reality is people of color are underrepresented in genetic databases, clinical trials and the medical profession\u2026and as a result, they often receive different, sub-standard care.\nThese are strange times. The past few months and especially the past few weeks, have strained not only society, but each of us in unimaginable ways. We\u2019ve gone from close, collegial and familial relationships to isolated, restless individuals. For some of us, the social isolation has eliminated our support structures, making it difficult to process new information, adapt and determine what to do next. That can show up as sleeplessness, anxiety, no sense of time, inexplicable anger, depression, despair and a number of other very real physical and mental impacts. Our minds struggle to make sense of the events of the past few weeks and months and how they affect our own identity. And, that hurts. For some, that hurt is greater than ever experienced before. Some need to take some time to heal and build their own resiliency, some need to know that their work is making a difference, and others need to know what to do next. All are acceptable responses.\nAs I have considered what we can do, what I can do, I had to acknowledge that I am not an expert in police or criminal justice systems, nor do I have any meaningful answers for widespread economic inequity. But I do have an understanding of the healthcare system and I can see ways that we can make a difference there\u2026a difference that can create durable change that will lead others to do the same. For example, we are currently studying the effect of sickle cell trait, which is prevalent in 8-10% of African Americans, on COVID-19 with Herman Taylor, MD (Morehouse School of Medicine and former director of the Jackson Heart Study) as a co-principal investigator. Dr. Taylor is also working with us to help recruit patients into our ACE inhibitor clinical trial to ensure adequate representation from the African American community in that important work.\nThrough other projects we\u2019re leading, our opportunity to directly impact and eliminate bias in the treatment of COVID-19, diabetes, colorectal cancer and other diseases is high. But we don\u2019t need to stop there. We recently launched a data platform to accelerate disease and system learning in academic circles. We have a health record that will be used across all areas of the company. We launched a depression and anxiety app to build resiliency. We have many, many studies and pilots underway in different disease states and different parts of the healthcare system. All of them can ensure access to all communities and be designed to get better results. All of them can show a path to illuminate and eliminate systemic bias and disparity across all of society. My opportunity is to clear the path for good projects...and by working together, we will make them go.\nEven in turmoil, I am an optimist. When I look at my grandsons, I have great hope for a better world.\n"}, "_id": "UnitedHealth Group.txt"}

Personally, these recent events have given me pause to reflect across the many aspects of my life -- as a leader, as a citizen, and as a parent.\nThese past few months have been especially difficult as the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified and compounded the inequalities of race and economics in our society and spotlighted issues that we have, quite frankly, not spent enough time talking about as a company and as a country.\nThere is a regrettable history of suffering and injustice in our Black community. While it is direct and personal to many of our Anthem associates, we are all affected. As we should be.\nAs I shared in\u00a0my last post, Anthem is rooted in the very fabric and history of local communities that are currently experiencing social unrest. These communities are not only where we live and work, but it\u2019s where we have always served others through a lens of inclusion, acceptance and belonging. It\u2019s always been a part of our foundation, a part of our founding tenets of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, and who we are as people. Our associates have always reflected the rich diversity of our communities, and that will not change. But I think this moment calls on us in a very unique way now to step up more intentionally to listen, to be heard and to act.\nAs a wise Anthem colleague told me last week: \u201cRecognition breeds change.\u201d I wholeheartedly believe that the more we see the world through each other\u2019s eyes, the better we can understand what is needed to create positive change.\nWe each have the ability\u2014and obligation\u2014to advance the change that is overdue and create a better future for everyone inside and outside the walls of Anthem. Listening matters. Words matter. Actions matter. And at Anthem, we are committed to doing more to challenge injustice and improve the lives and health of our communities.\nWe are beginning with some immediate actions:\n\t1.\tThrough a $50 million commitment over the next five years, we will be providing meaningful resources to organizations working to build a more just nation; this includes supporting social justice issues and addressing health disparities experienced in minority and underserved communities.\n\t2.\tWe will be matching donations made by Anthem associates to non-profit organizations dedicated to addressing social and health disparities across the country.\n\t3.\tWe will expand our strong volunteerism opportunities to work alongside small businesses to support their recovery and resilience through restoration and clean-up efforts.\nAnd that is just the start. More broadly across our organization, we will be doing more listening and learning. With the help of our Associate Resource Groups, we will engage in deeper and meaningful activities to bring about sustainable change across all of our businesses.\nThis is a time for healing, for reconciliation, and for action. This work won\u2019t stop. We can and will do more to ensure that all of our citizens, across all of our communities, are part of a more hopeful nation\u2014together.\n"}, "_id": "Anthem.txt"}

To\u00a0stand together, we must stand up for one another, and recognize the fear, hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the senseless killing of George Floyd and a much longer history of\u00a0racism.\nThat painful past is still present today \u2014 not only in the form of violence, but in the everyday experience of deeply rooted discrimination. We see it in our criminal justice system, in the disproportionate toll of disease on Black and Brown communities, in the inequalities in neighborhood services and the educations our children\u00a0receive.\nWhile our laws have changed, the reality is that their protections are still not universally applied. We\u2019ve seen progress since the America I grew up in, but it is similarly true that communities of color continue to endure discrimination and\u00a0trauma.\nI have heard from so many that you feel afraid \u2014 afraid in your communities, afraid in your daily lives, and, most cruelly of all, afraid in your own skin. We can have no society worth celebrating unless we can guarantee freedom from fear for every person who gives this country their love, labor, and\u00a0life.\nAt Apple, our mission has been and always will be to create technology that empowers people to change the world for the better. We\u2019ve always drawn strength from diversity, welcomed people from every walk of life to our stores around the world, and strived to build an Apple that is inclusive of\u00a0everyone.\nBut we must do more. We commit to continuing our work to bring critical resources and technology to underserved school systems. We commit to continuing to fight the forces of environmental injustice \u2014 like climate change \u2014 which disproportionately harm Black communities and other communities of color.

You matter and your lives\u00a0matter.\nThis is a moment when many people may want nothing more than a return to normalcy, or to a status quo that is only comfortable if we avert our gaze from injustice. As difficult as it may be to admit, that desire is itself a sign of privilege.

UPS will also continue its decades- long funding support of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and joint advocacy efforts to advance federal legislation critical for greater racial justice and equality. UPS will work with international organizations and national governments to advance United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 - Reduced Inequalities. This builds on existing UPS support for the principles articulated in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nIn the United States, the company has supported the passage of hate crimes legislation in Georgia, and has committed to urging the governors and legislatures of states without similar legislation \u2013 including Arkansas, South Carolina and Wyoming \u2013 to prioritize passing a bill.\nNew funding of $3.2 million through The UPS Foundation includes the following organizations: the NAACP, National Urban League, The Executive Leadership Council, 100 Black Men of America, The Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights\u2019 Education Fund, Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, United Negro College Fund, Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Spelman College, The National Center for Civil and Human Rights and the National Black Child Development Institute.\nGiven the importance of raising awareness of racial injustice among current and future generations, the company has committed $1 million to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The funding will support the museum\u2019s efforts to advance educational programing on historical and present day efforts to advance racial equality in the U.S. UPS believes better understanding and sharing of Black history and culture is critical to fostering greater empathy and understanding of the challenges and opportunities to overcome racism.\nUPS also is stepping up actions within the company. With almost 500,000 employees in more than 220 countries and territories, UPS\u2019s greatest strengths are the diversity of its people and the unique qualities each brings to work every day. In addition to advocating for legislative change, and funding and partnering with organizations that advance its core values of fairness, dignity and respect for all, the company is committed to ensuring all UPS employees experience these ideals within its workplaces around the world. To that end, UPS is expanding its internal unconscious bias training, creating regular forums for additional discussion regarding topics surrounding racial equality and justice, and expanding its internship program with historically Black colleges, among other actions.\nUPS has a proud tradition of volunteerism in the communities it serves and believes one of the most powerful ways to foster change is by engaging personally and directly to support racial equality. UPS, therefore, has pledged one million hours of employee volunteer service around the world in support of mentoring and educational programs in underserved Black communities globally.\n\u201cToday, we are reaffirming what we know is right and doing our part to accelerate progress.\u201d continued Tom\u00e9. \u201cWe will be champions for justice and equality, not just in our words but in our actions here in the U.S. and everywhere we operate around the world.\u201d\n"}, "_id": "UPS.txt"}

Unfortunately, we have seen this many times before. Not just from some in law enforcement, but others in our society who have hate in their hearts and racism in their lives.

I know it\u2019s not what AbbVie stands for and I know it\u2019s not what you stand for.\nDiverse communities in general, but the Black community more specifically, have lived with the harmful impacts of bias and racism for much too long. Hopefully the events of the last several weeks serve as a real wake-up call to all of us. This has to stop and it has to stop\u00a0now. It will start with each of us standing up and rejecting bias, racism, and the lack of real inclusion. This will require each of us to reach down inside ourselves and ask, \u201cDo I have bias, conscious or not?\u201d \u201cCan I do more to be inclusive?\u201d \u201cAm I showing up as an ally?\u201d \u201cCan I make my rejection of these behaviors clearer?\u201d\nIt requires self-reflection, followed by action\u2026.real and sustainable action!\nWe can\u2019t change the world, but we can make AbbVie a role model for fairness, inclusion, and the rejection of bias and racism. This is the time for us to \u201cstep up\u201d and say this has to \u201cSTOP\u201d!\nWe have built a wonderful culture at AbbVie. One of which we are very proud.

We can do more to make sure our culture is inclusive and welcoming for\u00a0everyone\u00a0and where all employees have the opportunity to grow and contribute. I made a commitment to our Black Business Network leaders that we will keep the lines of communication open to ensure that we are having an honest conversation about our culture of inclusion and belonging here at AbbVie.\nIn order to accomplish this objective, my leadership team and I are taking significant actions to ensure that AbbVie leads by example. We are committed to not only being a voice, but also doing the right things to fully embrace equality, diversity and inclusion and loudly reject racism and all forms of bias. We will also use our financial strength to make a positive impact on the diverse communities where we work and live.

More details regarding specific programs will be shared in the coming months.\n- The creation of two senior level positions that will sit on my leadership team to drive internal and external change:\n\t\u2022\tRae Livingston\u00a0has been named our chief equality officer.

This commitment will take significant research - listening to those in the community who truly understand what the needs are.\u00a0\u00a0\n- In light of my call to action and recent events, this Friday, June 19, AbbVie will observe Juneteenth to take the time to reflect on the changes that have to occur in our Company, our communities and society as a whole.\n- Providing a 2:1 match for employees who wish to support organizations working to help address racial equality and social justice issues.\n- Development of a comprehensive plan to accomplish our internal and external objectives to eliminate bias and racism and embrace total inclusion.\nI want to make my intentions here absolutely clear this isn\u2019t just a program, this is an absolute commitment that I am making, my leadership team is making and we need\u00a0all\u00a0of\u00a0you\u00a0to make as well.

{"_source": {"content": "June 12, 2020\nAdvancing Our Work on Racial Equity\nTo: Walmart associates\nFrom: Doug McMillon, President and CEO  Walmart\nThis time last week, we gathered virtually for our annual Associates Week celebration. It wasnt the same as being together in Bud Walton Arena, but it was great to recognize some tremendous associates and timely to set our expectations andshare our plans related to racial equity. Weve been encouraged by the strong response. Overwhelmingly, people expressed their support for the stance our company is taking on racial equity and on the commitment we made to act. It was especially great to see so many of you from across the company raise your hands to participate and be part of the effort to bring about change. This will take all of us and it starts with how we all do our jobs every day. I dont want much time to go by without giving you an update so thats the purpose of todays note.\nIn some ways, our path to acting reminds me of when we started our environmental and social sustainability efforts. People are seeking ways to help, volunteering their time and talents. And, like then, we have an enormous opportunity to use the scale of our business to make a difference. So, the work were starting leverages what weve learned from our approach to sustainability, womens economic empowerment, fighting hunger, hiring veterans and other initiatives.\nIn addition to immediate actions we may take, the next phase of our journey must start with listening and learning. Why? The systems we intend to influence for good are complex and long-standing. Absent those steps, well rush to action, miss opportunities and waste energy. And if we do that, well fail to achieve our goal: To help replace the structures of systemic racism, and build in their place frameworks of equity and justice that solidify our commitment to the belief that, without question, Black Lives Matter.\nWhere we see opportunities to act quickly, we will. But, simultaneously, well listen and learn. For many of you, that process has already started, and it likely intensified in recent weeks. My advice for each of us is to actively listen to each other, forgive well-intentioned questions or comments as we have what can be uncomfortable conversations, create a safe space for learning and be purposeful about what you read and listen to. Seek to learn. If youre asking yourself, What can I do? or Whats expected of me?, I would suggest you focus on how you engage with your fellow associates every day. Start there.\nI was talking to a former Walmart associate this week who is African American. She told me stories about her time at Walmart and gave me examples of where slight injustices occurred but because she so much wanted to avoid playing the race card she didnt speak up. And, the slight injustices piled up. How can you, as an anti-racist ally, create an environment where Blacks and African Americans, Hispanics and Latinos, Asians, Native Americans, LGBTQ, those with disabilities and women, dont feel its a big decision to speak up? Lets create a supportive, trustful environment where people can share how theyre feeling, so small issues dont stack up.\nBeyond our everyday individual behaviors, we will also act collectively as a company. We will create a more diverse and inclusive team at Walmart at every level. As a company that started in 1962, we arent just starting today. We currently have more than 352,000 Black and African American associates in the U.S.  21.5% of our workforce. Overall, 46.5% of our associates and 34% of our management are people of color. We have continued to increase our overall hiring of Black and African American associates, as well. In the last year, 28% of our new hires were Black or African American, and overall, 54% of new hires were people of color.\nOf course, we need to go further in hiring Black and African American associates across all levels and positions. And we need to ensure they are remaining with us and growing in their careers. We are encouraged by what were seeing in terms of growth and development specific to theLive Better U programgiven, since the launch of the program in 2018, 47% of our participants are associates of color. We want to ensure continued internal movement for Black, African American, and other diverse associates through the talent pipeline, so we will be deliberate about development opportunities. This will include kicking off new development programs for those associates, as well as posting all positions up to and including Vice President level. We will also focus on transparency in our practices and are committed to fair pay. Finally, we will be focused on listening, learning and elevating the voices of our Black and African American associates, ensuring that we drive changes that will lead to creating a Walmart where everyone feels included, valued, and has the equal opportunity for growth, development, rewards and impact.\nTo continue moving forward on this and the other initiatives we announced last week, we have begun designing teams to provide structure to the work and to begin organizing the approach. The first team weve established is a small group who will oversee the process, the development of strategies, and the resourcing of the work? That group will include me, Donna Morris, Ben Hasan, Dacona Smith, Latriece Watkins, Dan Bartlett and Rachel Brand. These leaders will provide guidance and support to five workstreams, four of which are related to national systems of finance, healthcare, education and criminal justice, and a fifth focused on inclusion within our company. In turn, each of these workstreams will be supported by teams of associates. Their job will be to listen and learn from other associates as well as thought leaders from outside Walmart so that they can identify and ultimately implement initiatives that will move us closer to our goals. We will share the names of the leaders for each workstream soon.\nThe following are the five workstreams and their initial objectives:\nFinancial System\nWe will look at our own financial and business practices to identify the overlaps in areas like minority supplier and marketplace seller development to identify initiatives that will help create greater opportunities for minority-owned businesses. Well also look for opportunities to influence how access to capital works beyond Walmart.\nHealthcare\nWe will explore ways to provide greater accessibility to better health and wellness through our existing businesses like pharmacy and, increasingly, our digital capabilities and our Walmart Health Clinics as we grow them. This group will look for places to improve for our own associates as well as customers.\nEducation\nIn Education, we will work to strengthen our academic support efforts such as Live Better U and creating broader and deeper ties through our recruiting programs with Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\nCriminal Justice\nWe will review and evolve our recruiting and hiring practices. An important component of this will take place in the criminal justice workstream. This group will be responsible for reviewing and evolving our hiring process to ensure non-violent, formerly incarcerated applicants are appropriately considered as they enter the workforce and focus on successfully onboarding those associates.\nInclusion\nIn addition to the work related to the four national systems, we will continue our efforts to build a more inclusive company, globally, with Richard Mayfield continuing in his leadership role of our Inclusion Council.\nCenter for Racial Equity\nWhile we will first look to address racial inequity through these business initiatives, we will also extend and accelerate our impact on society through the new center for racial equity. One of the centers primary responsibilities will be to direct the $100 million commitment to support philanthropic initiatives that complement Walmart initiatives to shape the four national systems weve identified above.\nThe centers initiatives will fund research, advocacy, innovation of practices and tools, stakeholder convening and support the work of Black philanthropic leaders and organizations that serve Black communities. The center will also provide counsel across Walmart to increase understanding and improve efforts that promote equity and address the structural racism that persists in America.\nOur philanthropic efforts will focus not only on allocation of the $100 million, we will also seek to expand our network to better reach organizations led by people of color, particularly African American-led organizations. We will stand up the center within our Walmart.org team in the coming weeks. As we do, we will aim to be transparent around the centers mission, its work, and the plans for allocating the $100 million.\nCollective Action\nThis combination of actions will get us started on this next phase of our journey in support of racial justice and equity. We will continue to benefit from the many ideas and insights we have received and notes of interest from associates across Walmart who want to contribute to this work. We will also be providing opportunities for participation through listening sessions and surveys.\nRemember that this all comes to life through the actions of each one of us - in our stores, Sams Clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and in communities across this country. Our collective beliefs and behaviors will make the difference.\nBlack Lives Matter. It is all our responsibilities to embrace that fact in what we say and what we do. Theres no way to live our values if we dont. So, lets push ourselves even harder to create an inclusive and equitable culture at Walmart  for each other, for our customers and for our communities. Thank you for doing your part.\n\n"}, "_id": "Walmart.txt"}

His cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d were ignored.\nIn February, a black man, Ahmaud Arbery, was shot by a white father and son while jogging through a Georgia neighborhood. It took months for arrests to be made.\nAnd, in March, Breonna Taylor \u2014 a black woman and Emergency Medical Technician who worked tirelessly to serve her community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Louisville, Kentucky \u2014 was killed in her home when three police officers forcibly entered her apartment in the middle of the night.\nThough hundreds of miles apart, these are not isolated issues. There are far too many other examples of racism, inequities and injustice. For example, the recent incident in Central Park where a white female called the police on an African American male who was simply bird watching and asked her to put her dog on a leash.\nThese events are deeply upsetting and unsettling to me. And I recognize that for many of my friends and colleagues these emotions are deep and personal.\nAs I reflect, I also thought of the other recent catastrophic events \u2026 the global COVID-19 pandemic \u2026 and the 500-year flooding that wiped out homes, businesses and property near our global headquarters. These have forced us at Dow to respond, adjust and\u00a0find a way\u00a0like we have never before. And, they have forced us to connect to our humanity and to support one another to overcome these challenges.\nOur response to issues of racism, inequities and injustice should be no different.\u2028\nWe know that hate, bias and racial division all remain woven into the fabric of our society, and we condemn these actions in the strongest of terms. We stand together with our family, friends, colleagues and neighbors to fight for change. This means proudly living Dow\u2019s core values of\u00a0Respect for People\u00a0and\u00a0Integrity.\nAt Dow, one of the four pillars of our ambition is to be the most inclusive materials science company in the world. Incidents like these reinforce why we must take deliberate actions every day to ensure that everyone feels like they belong. When people come to work, we want them to know they are part of Team Dow and that their individuality is valued because it makes us better and it makes us stronger. But, more than that, we reflect our core values to the world, and we advocate to make the places we live and work more inclusive.\nBut it\u2019s not just up to the African American community to fight the racism these incidents reflect. It\u2019s up to all of us, especially those of us who would likely never personally experience a situation like this.\nWe have to be allies and we must act.\nAs a member of the LGBTQ+ community, there is no question that allies have been critical to the advancements we\u2019ve made in terms of equality in recent history. Similarly, allies to the African American community do and will continue to play a critical role in addressing this challenge as well. That starts with moving beyond fear and taking action. It could be having courageous conversations with family members and loved ones. It could be engaging with people who don\u2019t look like you. Or it could be giving of our time or resources to organizations looking to address racism and inequality. It means, when we see injustice and inequity, we cannot be silent. We must stand up and speak out.\nAs a leader, but more importantly as a human being, I\u2019m committing to act on behalf of those who deal with racism, bigotry and the threat of violence everyday simply because of the color of their skin\u2026starting with Team Dow.\u00a0In keeping with this commitment and our commitments as a company to building an inclusive culture, I will be calling on our leadership team to ensure we are in fact doing all we can do to effect change.\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to do here to overcome hundreds of years of systemic oppression, but I am committed to helping Team Dow\u00a0find a way.\n"}, "_id": "Dow Chemical.txt"}

Against the backdrop of a global pandemic bringing death to hundreds of thousands, the world is now witness to the terrible images surrounding the death of George Floyd, and related protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country.\nOur sadness today is not just for the Floyd family but for our larger human family. So many of the pictures we\u2019ve seen this week \u2013 and in other recent weeks \u2013 are hard to watch. They are shocking. In many cases, they starkly underscore the cruelty of individual acts of hatred and the consequences of indifference to racism in too many parts of our society. More broadly, this week reminds us again of the distance between the American ideals we aspire to, and the daily realities of life for too many Americans, especially people of color.\nWe are fortunate to work at a company with a social mission rooted in fair and equal opportunity, respect, diversity, and inclusion. But we need to be honest about the disparities we know exist in our society, and diligent in continually finding ways to ensure that the values we espouse come to life in our workplace.\nLike many things, this is especially challenging while we\u2019re working remotely, but there are tools that can help. These include many training opportunities (including about issues in Our Code), our Courageous Conversations series that provide a safe space for discussion, counseling resources available through our Employee Assistance Program, and the many activities and programs of our Employee Resources Groups (ERGs), including the African Ancestry Business Leaders for Excellence (ABLE) ERG.\nWe have discussed this week\u2019s events with the other leaders on the Management Committee. We are united in our commitment to the hard work of not just opposing overt acts of racism, but of using this time to proactively advance diversity and inclusion within Fannie Mae. We also recognize that while the events in Minneapolis shock the consciences of all, they touch our African American employees in particular and painful ways.\nFor now, we must continue to be distant from our offices. But let\u2019s use this period to grow closer as a community and to live our values to their fullest. These times are hard. But let them steel us to meet the great challenges of this moment.\nHugh & Dave\n"}, "_id": "Fannie Mae.txt"}

We stand with you and support you. Standing on the sidelines is not an option. My commitment to you is to open my mind and my heart to listen and act. I ask all of us to do this, together.\nWe can start by living more deeply into our values. Inclusion is one of the six values that shapes who we are and the culture we are creating at Intel. We strive to build a culture of belonging. We create a space where everyone can contribute to their fullest potential and deliver their best work. We welcome differences, knowing it makes us better. I challenge every one of us to ask ourselves the hard questions. Am I building an inclusive team? Am I making it possible for everyone to show up at work as their whole selves? Am I role-modeling humanity? What more can I do \u2014 \u00a0especially right now?\nHave empathy and compassion for one another and seek to understand. Inform your thinking with diverse points of view. For all the managers at Intel, let\u2019s check in on our teams and have open conversations about what\u2019s happening because we know what happens outside of work impacts the work we do inside.\nMore broadly, though, we have a greater responsibility to drive change in the world. That is why our\u00a02030 corporate responsibility strategy and goals\u00a0include a deep focus on diversity and inclusion, including working with other companies to accelerate adoption of inclusive business practices across industries by creating and implementing a global inclusion index open standard. At a time when some companies are disinvesting in diversity and inclusion, we are investing more because it matters.\nIt\u2019s also why today Intel is pledging $1 million in support of efforts to address social injustice and anti-racism across various nonprofits and community organizations. I also encourage employees to consider donating to organizations focused on equity and social justice, including the Black Lives Matter Foundation, the\u00a0Center for Policing Equity\u00a0and the\u00a0NAACP Legal Defense Fund, all of which are eligible for Intel\u2019s Donation Matching Program.\nIt\u2019s with a heavy heart that I write this note because I\u2019ve heard from many of you who are feeling deep pain and sadness right now. I know I speak for the leadership team, our board of directors and our employees around the globe when I say: We are here for you. Together we will get through this. Together we will change the world and enrich the lives of EVERY person on Earth.\n\u2014 Bob\n"}, "_id": "Intel.txt"}
