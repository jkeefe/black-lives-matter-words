We are all confronting deep pain and anguish over the senseless killing of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and other unarmed Black men and women in our country. We cannot ignore that their deaths are part of a pattern of racism and reflect the harsh reality that as a nation we are much too far from fulfilling the promise of equal justice for all.  We must stand with all who are committed to change that will bring us closer to realizing an end to discrimination and hatred.
To promote actionable change, The Home Depot is contributing $1 million to the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in support of its vital work to secure civil rights and equal justice for all. Its mission is especially critical now as we work to build a more inclusive society. 
Over our company’s history, we have built an environment where we take care of each other, build strong relationships and value respect for all people. As I did in my note on Saturday, I want to thank our 400,000-plus associates for helping to uphold our values.  Diversity and respect for all people are core to who we are as an Orange-Blooded family. We do not support discrimination in any form, period.
We are all hurting, but none more acutely than those in our African American communities. Please know that you are not alone. We must work together and more urgently. To that end, I have begun working with our associate resource groups to facilitate internal town halls to share experiences and create better understanding among us all. 
We are dedicated to supporting you and our communities during this time with the goal of emerging more united than ever.
