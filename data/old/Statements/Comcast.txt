Racism, injustice and violence have no place in our society and cannot be tolerated. Yet we continue to be unable to make enough progress in this country â€“ so at this moment it is critical to step back, face the hard subjects and try to reflect.
I have talked with many employees and share their feelings of anger, frustration and outrage following the senseless killing of George Floyd, and other instances of violence against Black people. These atrocities run counter to everything our company stands for.
It is heartbreaking and tragic that in 2020, we find ourselves still struggling with issues that are so core to human dignity. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has also hit communities of color particularly hard, it is more important than ever that we be united, and yet it feels as if the opposite is the case.
At Comcast, we aspire to build better lives for all of us. We strive to have a diverse employee population and recognize that only by interacting with, and listening to people of all races, backgrounds, ethnicities, sexual orientations and abilities can we hope to truly understand and appreciate one another. And we are committed to using our platforms across the company to educate, inform and inspire the public.
I want to thank our courageous journalists at NBCUniversal for risking their safety to shine a light on what is happening, as well as our Comcast Cable field technicians and retail store employees who continue to put themselves on the frontlines to support our customers in even the most difficult circumstances. You make us very proud.
Honest dialogue is critical, as is fighting injustice wherever it exists. We are committed to being a champion for equality as we continue this journey together. Stay safe.
