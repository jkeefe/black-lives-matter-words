The globe on the trail of our aircraft represents our mission to connect people and unite the world. A world united, and the world we’re committed to help build, is one where we stand together against racism and in support of those working to promote reconciliation. We feel the anger, despair and grief that weighs on the hearts of so many, especially our black colleagues, customers and community. Black lives matter. 

Today we will gather in a virtual company-wide town hall, led by our CEO, Scott Kirby, and our President, Brett Hart, who won’t just talk about our business—but continue the conversation among our United family about how we can put our deeply-held values into action.
