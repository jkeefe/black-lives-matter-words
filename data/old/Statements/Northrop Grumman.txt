Northrop Grumman’s Commitment to Social Justice and Unity
We are experiencing grief, heartbreak and pain about the acts of senseless violence against Black men and women in our society.
The fears and injustices that many Black men, women and children face daily are real, and as a country, we need to address this. As a company, a community and a nation, we must stand together in solidarity and stand up for one another.
We stand in unity with the Black community. We are committed to fighting against racism and injustice. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, retaliation or hateful behavior.
We have a responsibility to enable change in our communities. To underscore our commitment, we have established a Social Justice Campaign through the Northrop Grumman Foundation. We are giving $1,000,000 to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and we are matching $1,000,000 of employees’ personal donations to organizations that focus on social justice and equality.
We are expanding our efforts to create a more diverse workforce and inclusive culture. We constantly look at what we are, can and should be doing to improve our hiring, training and advancement practices. We are asking all employees to listen and be open to having tough conversations, and we are providing them with new resources to help our teams engage. Our Diversity and Inclusion team is partnered closely with our African American Task Group, other Employee Resource Groups and our leaders to help with these candid conversations in the workplace, and to assess our current environment and identify ways to support healing in our communities.
