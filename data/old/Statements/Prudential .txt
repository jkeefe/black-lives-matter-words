Prudential is profoundly disturbed by the manner of George Floydâ€™s death, and by the fact that he joins a long and ever-growing list of Black Americans who have lost their lives because of the color of their skin.
We acknowledge the grief, fear and anger felt by our African-American colleagues, friends, and fellow citizens, as well as their families and communities, not just because of this latest tragedy, but because of the dangers, obstacles and humiliations they face due to racism, both overt and implicit.
As a values-based company that employs a diverse community of more than 20,000 employees across the U.S., we recognize our responsibility to help lead our society towards a future in which racism and unequal treatment play no part. Having been a part of, and invested in, our Newark, New Jersey community for more than 145 years, we know that we will ultimately be judged for our actions, and for outcomes that stand the test of time.
