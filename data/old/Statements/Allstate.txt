Systemic racism is pervasive and we must not be complicit by inaction or silence. For our society to eliminate the inequities in America, each of us needs to have the will to change, the heart to trust and the energy to lead. We are conducting a top-to-bottom review of our operating practices, pay and promotions for people of color and women to further promote equity and equality at Allstate.
Through the Allstate Foundation we will focus on accelerating equity and helping drive systemic change. Further, we are observing Juneteenth as an annual company holiday to provide Allstaters the opportunity to reflect on this monumental event and engage in their communities.
